# AI Agents Comparison

This workspace captures high-level insights for comparing multiple AI agents across question prompts and capability modes. The structure mirrors the planning spreadsheet shared in the reference image.

## Directory Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page placeholder for the comparison UI.
- `css/style.css` – Base styles for the eventual table view.
- `js/main.js` – Script stub that will hydrate the comparison data.
- `data/questions.json` – Source of question prompts and related notes.
- `data/details/` – Markdown files that hold the insight bullet points per agent, capability, and question.

## Next Steps

1. Replace placeholder insights with validated research outputs per agent.
2. Extend `main.js` to load the markdown files and render the comparison table dynamically.
3. Style the table in `style.css` to match the spreadsheet layout.
