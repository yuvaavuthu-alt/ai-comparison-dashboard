Verizon Flagship Smartphone Purchase Options (2025)

Flagship Models and Base Pricing

Verizon’s lineup of recent flagship phones includes Apple’s iPhone 17 series and top Androids like Samsung’s Galaxy S25 family and Google’s Pixel 10 series. These devices command high retail prices, generally in the $800–$1300 range. For example, an iPhone 17 Pro has a $1,099.99 full retail price ￼, while a Galaxy S25 Ultra is $1,299.99 retail ￼. The carrier offers 0% APR 36‑month device payment plans, so you can pay over time with no interest. A $1,200 phone works out to roughly $33.33 per month (e.g. the iPhone 17 Pro ≈$30.55/mo for 36 months ￼; Galaxy S25 Ultra ≈$36.11/mo ￼). Whether you pay the full price upfront or in installments, the total device cost is the same if no promotions apply. The key to saving money is leveraging Verizon’s promotional deals – especially trade‑in credits – which can drastically lower what you pay for these flagship phones.

Trade-In Promotions and Credits

Verizon is currently running aggressive trade-in promotions that can make flagship phones much cheaper (sometimes even “free”) for both new and existing customers. The exact discount depends on the phone model, the device you trade in, and your unlimited plan tier. Here are the highlights for Apple and Android flagships:
	•	iPhone 17 Series: Verizon offers up to $1,100 off any new iPhone 17 model (including iPhone 17, 17 Plus, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone Air) with a qualifying trade-in on an eligible unlimited plan ￼. This means if you trade an older phone (even damaged – “any condition, guaranteed”) you receive bill credits totaling as much as $1,100 over 36 months. In practice, the credit often matches or nearly matches the device price on higher-tier plans. For example: trading in a recent smartphone (Tier 1 device) for a base iPhone 17 (≈$829 retail) yields about a $830 credit when on an Unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan – essentially making the iPhone 17 $0 (on Verizon’s “on us￼” promotion) ￼. Even the pricier iPhone 17 Pro ($1,099 retail) can get up to $1,100 off with trade-in on select plans ￼, meaning a free iPhone 17 Pro (the credit maxes out at the device cost ￼). On the flip side, the same trade on a basic plan yields a much smaller discount – see the Plan Impact section below for details. Verizon also has a deal for switchers: if you’re moving to Verizon and open a new line, you can get an iPhone 17 free (via 36 monthly credits) with no trade-in required as long as you sign up for any myPlan unlimited plan ￼.
	•	Samsung Galaxy S25 Series: Similar promotions apply to Samsung’s 2025 flagships. Verizon announced that current or new customers can get a Galaxy S25 or S25+ “on us” (free) or $1,000 off a top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra with a qualifying trade-in on an Unlimited Ultimate plan ￼. In practice, trading a recent high-end phone can yield a credit up to the full price of the device. On Unlimited Ultimate, a Tier 1 trade-in gets $1,100 credit toward a Galaxy S25 Ultra (more than covering the ~$1,000 S25+ and fully covering smaller models) ￼. On Unlimited Plus, the trade credit tops out around $800 for any S25 model ￼. For instance, a Galaxy S25 5G (base model, $799.99 retail) would be completely free with an $800 credit on Plus/Ultimate plans ￼. Verizon even has no-trade deals: with a new line on Unlimited Ultimate, you could get a Galaxy S25 for $5/month (S25+ for $10/mo, S25 Ultra $15/mo) – effectively a large instant promo credit – with no trade-in ￼. (These no-trade prices are also over 36 months; e.g. $5/mo = $180, meaning Verizon knocks ~$620 off the $800 S25 price in that scenario.)
	•	Google Pixel 10 Series: Verizon’s offers for Google’s flagships follow the same template. A Pixel 10 Pro (~$999 retail) is free with a qualifying trade on Unlimited Ultimate (up to $1,000 credit over 36 months) ￼. On lower plans, the trade-in promo is a bit less – e.g. around $600–$800 off on Unlimited Plus/Welcome (so a Pixel 10 Pro might cost ~$199–$399 in that case). For the standard Pixel 10, Verizon advertises $800 off with a new line on any myPlan (making the ~$800 Pixel 10 effectively free as well) ￼. In short, whether it’s Apple, Samsung, or Google, Verizon is offering very high trade-in credits (hundreds of dollars, up to ~$1k) on flagship 5G phones – but the exact value “on the table” depends on your unlimited plan choice and the trade-in device tier.

Plan Tier Impact on Promotions (Unlimited Welcome vs. Plus vs. Ultimate)

Verizon’s unlimited myPlan comes in three tiers – Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, and Unlimited Ultimate – and your plan tier significantly affects your promo credits. All these plans qualify for promotional trade-in deals (Verizon confirms that on myPlan, even Welcome users are “eligible to receive our best in-market smartphone offer with trade-in” when upgrading ￼). However, the “best” offer amount itself is higher on the premium plans. In other words, higher-tier plans unlock larger trade-in credits, while the basic Welcome plan yields a more modest discount. For example:
	•	On Unlimited Ultimate, a Tier 1 trade-in gets the maximum credits (e.g. $1,000–$1,100 off high-end phones). We saw that for the Galaxy S25 series: a top trade nets $1,100 off an S25 Ultra on Ultimate, versus $800 on Plus or $400 on Welcome ￼. Similarly for iPhones, an Unlimited Ultimate customer trading an iPhone 15 Pro could get ~$830–$1,000 in credits toward a new iPhone 17, whereas a Welcome customer with the same trade might get only ~$360 credit ￼. Verizon’s fine print for the iPhone 17 promo notes “select myPlan required” for the up to $1,100 credit ￼ – in practice this means the highest credits are tied to Plus/Ultimate plans, and the Welcome plan is eligible but typically at a lower promotional value.
	•	On Unlimited Plus, the trade-in credits are usually high but a notch below Ultimate. For instance, Samsung’s promo chart shows Unlimited Plus users get a flat $800 credit for a Tier 1 trade on any S25 model ￼. That covers the full cost of a base Galaxy S25 ( $800 credit for a $799 phone = $0 cost), but for an S25 Ultra ($1299 retail) it leaves about $499 to pay. By comparison, an Ultimate user’s $1,100 credit would leave only ~$199 on that Ultra ￼. With iPhones, Unlimited Plus yields the same top credit as Ultimate on some models (e.g. ~$830 covers an iPhone 17 base fully ￼), but for more expensive iPhones the Plus plan credit might max at $830 while Ultimate can reach $1,000+. Bottom line: Unlimited Plus gets you most of the possible discount – often $800+ per device – just not always the absolute max.
	•	On Unlimited Welcome, you still get promotions but at the lowest credit values. A common pattern is ~$350–$400 credit for top-tier trade-ins on Welcome ￼. For example, trading a recent phone for an iPhone 17 on Welcome might only knock $360 off the price ￼ (versus $830 off on Plus/Ultimate). The Best Buy promotion data for Galaxy S25 confirms Welcome users get $400 off any S25 with a Tier 1 trade, whereas Plus/Ultimate get double or more ￼. So a Welcome customer would pay a lot more out-of-pocket for the same phone than a Plus/Ultimate customer, despite both being “eligible” for the deal. In short: Verizon incentivizes customers to choose higher service plans by offering much bigger device discounts on those plans.

It’s important to weigh the monthly plan cost increase against the extra savings on the phone. The Unlimited Welcome plan is Verizon’s cheapest 5G unlimited option – for a family of four, it costs about $120 per month total (approximately $30 per line with the multi-line discount) ￼. Unlimited Plus is more premium (includes 5G Ultra Wideband, 30GB hotspot, etc.) and costs roughly ~$160–$180 per month for four lines (around $40–$45/line). The top Unlimited Ultimate is about ~$200+ per month for four lines (around $50–$55 per line) in many cases ￼ ￼. That means upgrading from Welcome to Plus might add ~$40+ more per month on the family’s bill, and going to Ultimate could add ~$80+ more per month (before taxes/fees). Over 36 months, those plan upgrades cost thousands: +$$1,440 extra over 3 years to go from Welcome -> Plus (approx), or +$2,880 extra to go from Welcome -> Ultimate for four lines (rough estimate using ~$20 extra per line) ￼. Thus, one has to compare that to the incremental device savings. If Ultimate gives you $600 more off each phone than Welcome (e.g. $1,000 vs $400 credit), two phones save ~$1,200 more – but you’d pay nearly $2,500+ more in plan fees, which wipes out the savings. The next section runs through the math in detail.

36-Month Cost Scenarios: Which Option Is Cheapest?

For a family of four with only two lines upgrading to new 5G phones, the most cost-effective strategy will balance device discounts against plan costs. Below we compare four scenarios over a 36-month period:
	1.	Buy devices at full price (no promo) on the cheapest plan.
	2.	Trade in two old phones on Unlimited Welcome (lower credits, lowest plan cost).
	3.	Trade in on Unlimited Plus (higher credits, medium plan cost).
	4.	Trade in on Unlimited Ultimate (max credits, highest plan cost).

To illustrate, we assume two flagship phones around $1,200 retail each (for example, two iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,199.99 each ￼, or one iPhone and one Galaxy of similar price). We also assume the trade-in devices are “Tier 1” (qualifying for top promo credits). Plan pricing is estimated for 4 lines with autopay (approx. $120/mo Welcome, $160/mo Plus, $200/mo Ultimate as discussed). All costs are summed for 36 months: the total of device payments (after any credits) plus the service plan cost for three years.

Scenario (4 lines, 2 new devices)	Device Cost for 2 Phones (36 mos)	Plan Cost for 36 mos	Total 36-Month Cost
No Promo (Full Price) – 2 devices @ ~$1,200 each, on Welcome plan.	~$2,400 (no credits)	~$4,320 (Welcome @ $120/mo × 36)	~$6,720
Trade-in on Unlimited Welcome – ~$400 credit per device ￼.	~$1,600 (after ~$800 total credit)	~$4,320 (Welcome plan)	~$5,920
Trade-in on Unlimited Plus – ~$800 credit per device ￼.	~$800 (after ~$1,600 total credit)	~$5,760 (Plus @ ~$160/mo × 36)	~$6,560
Trade-in on Unlimited Ultimate – ~$1,000 credit per device.	~$400 (after ~$2,000 total credit)	~$7,200 (Ultimate @ ~$200/mo × 36)	~$7,600

Table: Estimated 36-month total cost for a family of four in different upgrade scenarios. (Device costs assume two ~$1,200 phones. Plan costs assume all four lines on the indicated plan.)

Looking at the totals, the cheapest 3-year cost comes from keeping the Unlimited Welcome plan and using whatever trade-in credits are available. In our example, trading in two phones on Welcome saved $800 (total) on the devices, bringing the 36-month family cost to about $5.9k. This is several hundred dollars less than the next-best scenario, which was upgrading to Plus for bigger credits ($6.56k total). The Ultimate plan scenario, despite nearly zero-cost devices, ends up the most expensive overall (~$7.6k) due to the much higher service fees. The pattern holds generally: the lower monthly bills on Welcome outweigh the richer device credits of Plus/Ultimate when only 2 of 4 lines are upgrading. Verizon’s own customers have noted this trade-off – one user calculated that paying $15 more per line for Plus (over Welcome) costs $540 per line over 36 months, which can wipe out a “free” phone deal’s value if only one line upgrades ￼. In our family scenario, paying an extra ~$40–$80/month for the whole account (to get on a higher tier plan) ends up costing far more over 3 years than the ~$400–$600 per device you’d save by doing so ￼.

Mix-and-Match Note: Verizon allows mixing different myPlan tiers on different lines, which means the family could choose to put just the two upgrading lines on Plus or Ultimate (to get max credits) while keeping the other two on Welcome. This would reduce the plan cost penalty. (Each line’s price is determined by the total number of unlimited lines on the account – e.g. four lines get a $20/line discount regardless of tier ￼ ￼ – so mixing doesn’t forfeit multi-line discounts, but the Plus/Ultimate lines will still cost more individually.) A mixed-plan approach might save a bit more than the all-Welcome scenario if executed optimally. However, for simplicity, our table assumed all lines on one plan. Even with creative mixing, Welcome lines with smaller credits are generally the most budget-friendly route unless every line on the account is getting a new promo phone.

Conclusion: Best Value Configuration

For a family of four where only two members are upgrading to new flagship 5G phones, the lowest total cost approach is: stick with the Unlimited Welcome plan and take the available trade-in credits on those two devices. You’ll still get substantial promo savings – e.g. around $350–$400 off per phone on Welcome trades ￼ – and you’ll enjoy the lowest service bill (about $30/line). Over 36 months, this yields a lower overall expenditure than moving up to a pricier plan just to maximize the one-time device credits. In contrast, upgrading all four lines to Unlimited Ultimate could make the two new phones nearly free (credits of ~$1,000 each), but it would add roughly $2,000+ in extra plan fees over three years ￼ – not a wise trade-off if saving money is the goal.

That said, each family’s situation may differ. If, for example, all four lines were getting new devices, the math would tilt more in favor of the higher-tier plans since four promo credits might outweigh the higher plan cost. Also, some customers value the higher-tier plans’ perks (like 5G UW, big hotspot allotments, and faster “premium” data) – those benefits, combined with device deals, might justify the cost for them. But purely on dollars-and-cents for a two-upgrade scenario, Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome plan with 36-month device financing and trade-in credits provides the best bang for the buck ￼ ￼. You’ll get two of the latest flagship smartphones at a heavily discounted effective price, all while keeping your family’s monthly service bill as low as possible.
