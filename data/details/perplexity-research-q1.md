## Verizon Unlimited Ultimate: Complete Perks and Benefits Guide

Upgrading from Unlimited Welcome to Unlimited Ultimate will give you access to Verizon's top-tier plan with substantial enhancements across data, international features, device discounts, and premium network access. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of what you'll receive:

### Core Network Features

**Premium 5G Ultra Wideband Access**
You'll get unlimited access to Verizon's fastest 5G Ultra Wideband network with no throttling or deprioritization, regardless of how much data you use. This is significantly faster than the standard 5G on your current Welcome plan, which caps Ultra Wideband speeds at 25Mbps.[1][2][3][4]

**Enhanced Video Calling**
The plan includes Enhanced Video Calling, which uses advanced network slicing technology to deliver optimized video and sound quality on calling apps, even during peak usage times. This feature works in over 150 metropolitan areas on iPhone 14 and newer (iOS 18.2+) and select Samsung and Pixel devices.[5][6][1]

**Superior Video Streaming**
While your current plan limits video to 480p standard definition, Unlimited Ultimate supports up to 1080p HD streaming on 5G Nationwide and 4G LTE networks, and 4K UHD streaming when connected to 5G Ultra Wideband.[7][4][8][1]

### Mobile Hotspot

You'll receive a massive upgrade in mobile hotspot data: **200GB of high-speed hotspot data per month**, compared to no premium hotspot on your Welcome plan. After reaching 200GB, speeds reduce to 6Mbps on Ultra Wideband and 3Mbps on other networks. You can also add an additional 100GB of hotspot data for just $10/month through myPlan add-ons, bringing your total potential to 260GB.[2][9][3][10][11][12][7]

### International Benefits

**Unlimited International Roaming**
When traveling abroad, you'll get unlimited talk, text, and data in 210+ countries and destinations. This includes:[10][1][2]

- **15GB of high-speed international data per month** (recently increased from 10GB), after which speeds reduce to 1.5Mbps for the remainder of your billing cycle[9][11][8][10]
- **2GB of high-speed data per day in Mexico and Canada**, followed by unlimited 3G speeds[7][10]
- Unlimited international texting to over 200 countries[12]

**Global Choice International Calling**
The plan includes Global Choice, allowing you to select one country and receive up to 300 calling minutes per month to that country from the US, plus discounted rates afterward and to 220+ other countries. You also get unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada from the US.[13][14][1][10]

### Free Satellite Messaging

Unlimited Ultimate includes **free satellite messaging** for staying connected in areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. This feature works on:[15][16][1]
- iPhone 14 and newer (iOS 18+) for SOS messaging and iMessage/SMS texts
- Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Z Fold7, Z Flip7, Google Pixel 9/10 series for SOS alerts and texts

### Device and Connected Line Discounts

**Ultimate Phone Upgrade Guarantee**
You'll receive Verizon's best phone and device promotions when upgrading, with better trade-in deals than lower-tier plans. This applies to both new and existing customers, meaning you get the same premium offers whether you're upgrading now or in the future.[17][18][19][1]

**50% Off Two Connected Device Plans**
Save up to 50% on monthly service for two connected devices like smartwatches, tablets, mobile hotspots, or Hum devices. This is double the discount compared to Unlimited Plus, which only offers 50% off one device.[20][21][19][1]

### Home Internet Savings

**Mobile + Home Discount**
When bundled with Verizon home internet (Fios or 5G Home), you can save $15/month on your home internet bill. With Fios Gigabit Internet specifically, you can save up to $10 per month per mobile line on your wireless bill. You may also qualify for up to $10/month credit toward eligible myPlan perks like streaming services.[22][23][24]

### myPlan Customizable Add-Ons

All add-ons cost $10/month (except Apple One at $15/month) and can be added or removed monthly for flexibility:[25][12]

- **YouTube Premium** (exclusive $10/month price - 30% savings)[17][12]
- **Disney Bundle** (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+)[12][7]
- **Netflix & Max** (with ads)[17][12]

- **2TB cloud storage**[12]

### Price Lock Guarantee

Unlimited Ultimate includes Verizon's industry-first **3-year price lock guarantee**. Your core monthly plan price for calling, data, and texting won't increase for three years (excluding taxes, fees, and perks). This guarantee automatically resets for another three years whenever you change your myPlan.[27][28][29][1]

### Pricing

- **Single line**: $90/month with Auto Pay and paper-free billing[3][11][30]
- **4 lines**: $55/month per line ($220 total)[30][3]
- **3 lines**: $65/month per line ($195 total)[31]
