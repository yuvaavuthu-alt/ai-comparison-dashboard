Verizon Unlimited Ultimate vs Unlimited Welcome Plan Comparison (November 2025)

￼ ￼Verizon’s Unlimited Ultimate is the top-tier myPlan offering with all-inclusive features, whereas Unlimited Welcome serves as an entry-level unlimited plan focused on the basics. Below is a comprehensive comparison of perks, features, and benefits of Unlimited Ultimate versus Unlimited Welcome, including data speeds, hotspot, international benefits, streaming, device deals, bundling discounts, pricing, and exclusive perks.

Plan Features Overview

The table below summarizes key features and perks of Unlimited Ultimate and Unlimited Welcome:

Feature / Perk	Unlimited Welcome (Base Plan)	Unlimited Ultimate (Top Tier)
5G Network Access	5G Nationwide (basic 5G on low-band spectrum; no 5G Ultra Wideband) ￼ ￼. Offers reliable 4G LTE and sub-6 5G coverage, but speeds may be slower in congested areas without priority data ￼.	5G Ultra Wideband included – access Verizon’s fastest 5G (C-band and mmWave) for 3× faster speeds than standard 5G ￼ ￼. Delivers the “ultimate network experience” with priority data (no slowdowns due to deprioritization, regardless of usage) on 5G UW ￼ ￼.
Premium Data (Deprioritization)	Standard priority only. Data can be temporarily slowed during congestion since no guaranteed premium data allowance is provided ￼. (Older “Welcome Unlimited” was deprioritized after ~2GB in congestion ￼, but the current Unlimited Welcome provides basic unlimited data with possible slowdowns when network is busy.)	Premium network access on device at all times – no fixed data cap before slowdowns on smartphone data. Unlimited Ultimate users enjoy top priority on the network (even under congestion) for on-device data usage ￼ ￼.
Video Streaming Quality	Up to 720p HD on device by default ￼. (Video streaming is capped at DVD/HD-ready quality; e.g. 720p when on 5G or LTE. No 4K without UW and higher-tier plan.)	Up to 1080p Full HD on 4G/5G, and up to 4K Ultra HD when connected to 5G Ultra Wideband ￼ ￼. Unlimited Ultimate supports Enhanced Video Calling, improving video call quality on apps during congestion ￼ ￼.
Mobile Hotspot	Not included by default. No mobile hotspot allowance is built into Unlimited Welcome ￼ ￼. (Customers on this plan can add a hotspot perk for an extra fee, but the base plan has no hotspot data.)	Unlimited mobile hotspot data included ￼ ￼. 200 GB of high-speed hotspot per month, then unlimited hotspot at ~6 Mbps for the rest of the cycle ￼ ￼. (If 200 GB is exceeded, you can still tether at 6 Mbps, or buy data boosts to restore full speed ￼.) This effectively provides one of the largest hotspot allowances on the market.
Talk & Text	Unlimited talk and text in the U.S., as with all Verizon postpaid plans ￼. Includes free international texting from the U.S. to other countries ￼ ￼.	Unlimited talk & text, including free international texting from the U.S. as well ￼ ￼. (All “myPlan” tiers share unlimited talk/text and texting abroad from the U.S.)
Mexico & Canada Roaming	Included: Unlimited talk, text & data usage in Mexico and Canada at no extra charge ￼ ￼. (Standard roaming conditions apply, typically up to LTE speeds in those countries.)	Included: Unlimited talk, text & data in Mexico and Canada as well ￼. (All current unlimited plans cover Mexico/Canada roaming.)
International Roaming (Global)	Not included beyond North America. For travel in other countries, TravelPass ($12/day) is available – it’s automatically added and only charges on days used ￼. No built-in global data allotment; you pay per day when abroad (210+ supported countries via TravelPass).	Unlimited international roaming in 210+ countries – a standout perk of Ultimate ￼ ￼. Includes 15 GB per month of high-speed data while abroad, then unlimited data at 1.5 Mbps for the rest of the month ￼ ￼. Also includes unlimited talk & text in 210+ destinations without daily fees ￼. (If you exceed 15 GB, you can purchase extra high-speed data (2 GB for $10), or continue at 1.5 Mbps for free) ￼. Bottom line: Ultimate lets you use your phone abroad like at home (with a generous high-speed cap), whereas Welcome users must pay per day for TravelPass ￼.
International Calling (from U.S.)	No international calling minutes included (beyond free texting). You can add a paid international calling plan or pay per-minute rates to call overseas from the U.S. (Unlimited Welcome does not include Global Choice) ￼.	Global Choice international calling included: You can select one of 140 countries and get up to 300 minutes/month of calls from the U.S. to that country at no extra cost ￼ ￼. (After the included minutes, discounted calling rates apply.) This perk is bundled with Unlimited Ultimate, making it ideal for those who regularly call abroad ￼.
Streaming Services & Entertainment Perks	None included by default. Unlimited Welcome has no bundled subscriptions (e.g. Disney+ or Apple Music are not automatically included). However, optional $10/month “+play” perks can be added: customers can choose and pay for perks like Disney+ bundle, Apple One, Walmart+, etc., on any myPlan tier ￼. (Unlimited Welcome is compatible with the myPlan perks system, so you can add entertainment or extra hotspot data as paid perks if desired.)	None included by default. Verizon’s myPlan structure lets Ultimate customers pick their own perks for $10 each, but the plan itself doesn’t come with free subscriptions automatically ￼. (This is a shift from older plans that included services; now even on the top tier you add only what you want.) However, Unlimited Ultimate users may benefit from occasional promos or “Perk on Us” credits. For example, with certain Verizon Home Internet plans, Verizon offers a $10 credit that can offset one perk’s cost ￼ – effectively giving an Ultimate user one free perk (terms apply).
Device Upgrade & Trade-In Deals	Welcome Phone Upgrade Guarantee: New and existing Unlimited Welcome customers are eligible for phone trade-in deals when adding a line or upgrading, typically every 36 months (when device is paid off/upgrade-eligible) ￼ ￼. However, some top-tier promotions may be excluded – the base Welcome plan historically had restrictions on certain flagship deals ￼ ￼. (Notably, the older “Welcome Unlimited” was not eligible for device promo credits, though the current Unlimited Welcome allows standard upgrade offers with trade-in.) In short, you’ll get deals on new phones, but the most generous promotions (e.g. huge trade-in credits) may require higher plans ￼.	
	Upgrade Promise: Unlimited Welcome ensures existing customers get the same device offers as new customers at upgrade time ￼. Once you’re on this plan for 36 months, you’ll qualify for a new promo deal with trade-in, similar to how new lines get offers ￼.	
Device/Accessory Plan Discounts	Limited: No included accessory discounts on base plan. (Unlimited Welcome does not advertise any connected device plan discount.) Some Mobile + Home deals (see below) and bring-your-own-phone credits may still apply, but no watch/tablet monthly discount is included ￼ ￼.	Yes – 50% off up to 2 device plans: Unlimited Ultimate customers can get 50% off monthly fees on two eligible connected device lines (e.g. a smartwatch, tablet, laptop, hotspot, or Hum car Wi-Fi) ￼. For example, you could have two smartwatch or tablet lines at half price. (By contrast, the mid-tier Unlimited Plus offers 50% off one device plan) ￼ ￼. This is a valuable perk for those with multiple gadgets.
Home Internet Bundle Discount	Yes – eligible for Verizon’s Mobile + Home Discount: save $25/month on Verizon Home Internet (Fios, 5G Home, or LTE Home) when you have an unlimited mobile plan with autopay ￼ ￼. Unlimited Welcome qualifies for the same $25 off home internet as other unlimited plans ￼. (Note: The previous Welcome Unlimited had limitations, but under myPlan, the home internet discount applies to all current Unlimited plans ￼ ￼.)	Yes – also eligible for the $25/month Mobile + Home Discount on Verizon Home Internet ￼ ￼. (All myPlan tiers, including Ultimate, get the same home internet savings.) Ultimate users also enjoy the connected device discounts (above), which can be seen as a form of bundling benefit for adding other Verizon services.
Price (Monthly)	Base price: $65/month for 1 line (before discounts). With $10 autopay discount: $55/month for 1 line ￼.  Multi-line: 2 lines ~$50/line; 3 lines ~$40/line; 4 lines ~$25/line (4 for $100) with autopay ￼. These are among Verizon’s lowest postpaid rates per line, but remember this plan omits many extras. (Prices exclude taxes/fees. Autopay discount applied. Old “Welcome Unlimited” was $30/line for 4 lines; the current pricing is similar ￼.)	Premium price: $80/month for 1 line (base). With $10 autopay: $70/month for 1 line ￼.  Multi-line: 2 lines ~$65/line; 3 lines ~$50/line; 4 lines ~$40/line (4 for $160) with autopay ￼. This is Verizon’s most expensive plan, reflecting its added perks. (Prices exclude taxes/fees. Note that all myPlan tiers come with a 3-year price lock guarantee on the plan’s base price ￼ ￼.)

Sources: Official Verizon plan details ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ and support FAQs ￼ ￼ were used for the above comparison.

Mobile Data, Speeds, and 5G Access

Network Access: Unlimited Ultimate includes full 5G Ultra Wideband coverage, whereas Unlimited Welcome only has Verizon’s standard 5G. This means Ultimate users can tap into Verizon’s fastest 5G (including C-band mid-band and mmWave) for much higher speeds, roughly 3× faster than low-band 5G ￼. Welcome users are limited to 4G LTE and “5G Nationwide” (low-band 5G), which offers broad coverage but not the highest speeds ￼. In practice, Unlimited Ultimate users enjoy superior data speeds and capacity, especially in urban areas with Ultra Wideband deployment ￼ ￼.

Premium Data: A crucial difference is network priority. Unlimited Ultimate provides essentially unlimited premium data on smartphones – your on-device data won’t be deprioritized no matter how much you use (within reasonable network management) ￼ ￼. In contrast, Unlimited Welcome has no guaranteed premium data allowance, so your data may be temporarily slowed during congestion to prioritize higher-tier users ￼. (The older Welcome Unlimited plan even had speeds capped to 1 Mbps after 2 GB of use in a month ￼, though the current Unlimited Welcome doesn’t impose a fixed cap like that; it still can be slower on busy towers due to having the lowest priority.)

Video Streaming: Unlimited Welcome is limited to HD video streaming (typically 720p) quality on-device ￼. Unlimited Ultimate supports full HD 1080p streaming on 4G/5G, and even 4K Ultra HD streaming when connected to 5G Ultra Wideband (with a capable device and by toggling the quality in settings) ￼ ￼. In essence, Ultimate can deliver much higher video resolution (up to 4K) under the right conditions, whereas Welcome caps video at a lower resolution. This affects streaming on platforms like YouTube or Netflix over cellular.

Enhanced Video Calling: As an exclusive perk of the top tier, Unlimited Ultimate includes Enhanced Video Calling in certain 5G UW areas ￼. This network feature improves video call quality (FaceTime, Zoom, etc.) by optimizing resolution and reducing choppiness during times of congestion ￼. Unlimited Welcome does not include this enhancement (since it lacks 5G UW access), so video calls on Welcome are standard quality.

Mobile Hotspot Allowances

The Unlimited Ultimate plan far exceeds Unlimited Welcome in mobile hotspot capability. Unlimited Welcome does not include any mobile hotspot data – out of the box, you cannot use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot without purchasing an add-on. If you try to enable tethering on a Welcome line, it’s not part of the plan’s allowance (Verizon offered a paid perk of e.g. 100 GB hotspot for $10, but even that perk was unavailable to the old Welcome Unlimited ￼). In short, hotspot is essentially disabled on Unlimited Welcome by default.

By contrast, Unlimited Ultimate includes unlimited hotspot use. Users get 200 GB of high-speed hotspot data each month, drawn from Verizon’s 5G UW / 5G / 4G networks ￼ ￼. After 200 GB of tethering in a billing cycle, you can continue to use hotspot data without overage fees, but at a throttled speed of up to 6 Mbps for the remainder of the month ￼ ￼. Even 6 Mbps is usable for basic tasks (email, music streaming, standard-definition video) – and that’s after 200 GB of usage, which is a very high threshold. ￼ ￼

This generous hotspot perk makes Unlimited Ultimate suitable for heavy tethering needs (working on a laptop, streaming on other devices, etc.). In fact, 200 GB is one of the largest high-speed hotspot allowances in any consumer plan. For comparison, the mid-tier Unlimited Plus offers 30 GB of high-speed hotspot then throttles to 3 Mbps on 5G UW (600 Kbps on LTE) ￼ ￼, and Welcome has 0 GB included. Thus, Ultimate is clearly the choice if you need significant mobile hotspot data.

(If an Unlimited Ultimate user somehow uses up 200 GB and needs full speed again, Verizon allows purchasing a 5 GB Hotspot Data Boost for $35, up to 20 boosts per month ￼. That’s generally not needed for most users, given the large included allotment.)

International Roaming & Calling

Roaming in Mexico/Canada: Both plans include free roaming in Mexico and Canada – you can use your phone in Canada or Mexico just like in the US (unlimited talk, text, and data) at no additional charge ￼ ￼. This is standard across Verizon’s unlimited plans. Data speeds may be 4G LTE and could be subject to fair use policies, but there’s no daily fee or strict cap in these two countries.

Global Roaming (210+ Countries): Here the difference is dramatic. Unlimited Welcome does not include international roaming beyond North America. If you travel overseas (Europe, Asia, etc.), you’ll need to use TravelPass, which costs $12 per day per line for access to your plan’s talk/text/data abroad ￼. TravelPass only charges on days you use it, but it can add up for long trips. There is no monthly allotment – it’s purely pay-per-day if you want to use your phone internationally.

Unlimited Ultimate, on the other hand, includes built-in international roaming privileges in 210+ countries ￼ ￼. This means Ultimate customers do not have to pay $10-$12/day for TravelPass in most countries; the ability to use data, talk, and text abroad is covered by the plan. Specifically, Unlimited Ultimate provides 15 GB per month of high-speed data while overseas, then unlimited data throttled to 1.5 Mbps after that cap ￼ ￼. You also get unlimited talk and text in those countries as part of the plan ￼. In effect, an Ultimate user can travel the world and use Google Maps, email, messaging, and even light video at 1.5 Mbps without worrying about extra fees – a huge value for travelers. Verizon notes that after using 15 GB internationally, you can also buy additional high-speed data (2 GB for $10) if needed ￼, but otherwise you’ll still have basic connectivity at 1.5 Mbps for the rest of the month at no charge.

This global roaming inclusion is an exclusive perk of Unlimited Ultimate (and not offered on Welcome or even the mid-tier Plus) ￼ ￼. It makes Unlimited Ultimate very appealing to frequent travelers. By contrast, a Welcome user on a two-week trip overseas would rack up roughly $168 in TravelPass fees (14 days × $12), whereas an Ultimate user would pay $0 in daily fees and likely never notice moderate usage under 15 GB.

International Calling from the U.S.: Unlimited Welcome includes unlimited texting to international numbers from the U.S., but no free international calling minutes ￼. If you need to call overseas regularly, you’d have to add an international calling plan (such as Global Choice for $10/month per country, or a pay-as-you-go rate plan).

Unlimited Ultimate includes international calling as part of the plan: you get Global Choice included, which lets you pick one country to call and gives you up to 300 minutes per month of calls to that country for free ￼ ￼. This is built into the plan cost. You can choose from 140 countries; depending on the country, Verizon provides 300 minutes (or in some cases 100 or 200 minutes for certain destinations) as your included allowance ￼. After those minutes, you continue at a discounted per-minute rate. This perk essentially saves ~$10/month (the normal price of a Global Choice add-on) and is great if you have family or business in a specific country.

To summarize, Unlimited Ultimate is tailored for international use – roam freely around the globe and call abroad with less worry – whereas Unlimited Welcome is domestic-focused – fine for U.S. usage and short Canada/Mexico trips, but not generous for overseas travel.

Streaming & Entertainment Perks

Under Verizon’s new myPlan structure, neither Unlimited Welcome nor Unlimited Ultimate include streaming service subscriptions by default ￼. This is a change from older plans (where top-tier plans included Disney+, Apple Music, etc.). Verizon now lets customers customize their perks: you can add entertainment perks a la carte for an extra $10 per month, per perk, on any line.

Optional Perks: Both plans allow adding the same $10/month perks such as:
	•	Disney+ Bundle (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) ￼
	•	Netflix & Max bundle ￼
	•	Apple One (Apple Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud) or Apple Music alone
	•	Walmart+ membership, etc.
	•	100 GB mobile hotspot (for Welcome or Plus users who want more hotspot than their plan includes)
	•	3 TravelPass Days (an international perk to get 3 free roaming days per month)

Each line can choose which perk(s) they want (or none). Unlimited Ultimate, Plus, and Welcome all support the perks system ￼, so there’s no difference in the selection of entertainment perks available – the difference is simply that Ultimate already has hotspot and travel covered, so Ultimate users might use their perk slots for entertainment services, while Welcome users might be more inclined to buy a hotspot or TravelPass perk.

Included Subscriptions: There are no included streaming subscriptions with Unlimited Welcome – it’s a bare-bones plan. Unlimited Ultimate also does not include any by default, but Verizon often markets that with Ultimate you “only pay for what you want” (pick your perks) ￼. In essence, both plans require you to pay extra for things like Disney+ or Hulu.

However, Verizon has offered promos and bundle credits especially for higher-tier customers. One example is the “perk on us” credit for customers who have both a mobile plan and a home internet plan: if you have Unlimited Ultimate and, say, 5G Home Internet, Verizon gives a $10 monthly credit that effectively covers one perk’s cost ￼. This means an Ultimate customer with Verizon Home Internet could get a $10 perk (like Disney+ bundle) effectively for free. Unlimited Welcome customers could also potentially get this if they have the qualifying home internet, but the program has been targeted more at premium plan users.

In summary, streaming perks are optional-add for both plans – neither comes with free streaming services included. Unlimited Ultimate’s advantage lies not in pre-included content, but in the fact you have more core benefits (network, roaming, etc.) and you can then add the exact streaming services you value. Unlimited Welcome gives you the option to add perks too, but adding many perks erodes its price advantage, so consider upgrading to Plus/Ultimate if you find yourself wanting multiple $10 perks.

Device Upgrade & Trade-In Deals

Verizon often ties its best device promotions (like $800–$1,000 trade-in credits for new smartphones) to being on an eligible unlimited plan. Here’s how the two plans compare:
	•	Unlimited Welcome – With the Welcome Phone Upgrade Guarantee, new and existing customers on this plan can get device promotions with a trade-in when upgrading or adding a line ￼. In practice, this means if you have an older phone to trade, you’ll qualify for whatever the current promo is (e.g. “$700 off iPhone with trade-in”). After you use a promo, you’ll become eligible for a new promo again after 36 months (or once your device is paid off/upgrade-eligible) ￼. Verizon ensures that existing customers on Welcome get “the same phone offers now & when you upgrade” as a new customer would, which is a big improvement over earlier policies where some deals were for new lines only.
However, there are a few restrictions to note for Welcome users:
	•	The retired “Welcome Unlimited” (the previous version of this plan) was not eligible for many device promo credits ￼. The current Unlimited Welcome (myPlan) is eligible, but some top-tier deals might still favor Plus/Ultimate. For example, certain “best phone deals” or early upgrade offers might require at least Unlimited Plus. TechRadar notes that phone deal eligibility is restricted on the Welcome tier ￼ – essentially, double-check if the flagship phone promo you want is allowed on the Welcome plan.
	•	Unlimited Welcome is not eligible for the “best phone deals guaranteed” program that Ultimate has. It gets you standard promotional offers, but Unlimited Ultimate guarantees the highest level of promotional savings (often reserved for premium plans).
	•	Unlimited Ultimate – This plan comes with Ultimate Phone Upgrade Guaranteed, meaning new and existing customers get Verizon’s best phone deals, guaranteed ￼. Practically, if you’re on Ultimate, you qualify for all the top promotions (including those with huge trade-in credits) both when starting the plan (switching or adding a line) and every 36 months thereafter when you’re upgrade-eligible again ￼ ￼. Verizon explicitly states that on Unlimited Ultimate, customers get its “best current in-market smartphone offers” with trade-in, whether upgrading or activating a new line ￼. This includes deals that might give existing customers the same $800–$1000 off as new lines.
In short, Unlimited Ultimate ensures you won’t miss out on any device promotion because of your plan. If a deal is out there, Ultimate users will be eligible for it (with the usual trade-in and/or contract requirements). Verizon essentially treats Ultimate customers as premium, so they get the same top-tier device pricing as new customers or more expensive plans at all times.
Example: Suppose Verizon is offering $1,000 off a new 5G phone with trade-in, but requires a “select 5G Unlimited plan” – Unlimited Ultimate definitely qualifies (and usually Unlimited Plus does too, whereas Unlimited Welcome might or might not, depending on the fine print). Ultimate users can confidently get the maximum discount. If an Unlimited Welcome user finds a particular deal doesn’t apply on their plan, upgrading to Ultimate would resolve that.

Additionally, Ultimate (and Plus) plans have a slight advantage if you already used a promo and want to upgrade early. If you’re on Ultimate and your line is past 36 months or paid off, you get a fresh shot at deals. On Welcome, it’s similar – 36 months – but the difference is the level of deals you can access. Verizon’s wording “best phone deals guaranteed” ￼ ￼ implies Ultimate might occasionally have exclusive early upgrade incentives or more generous trade-in credits.

Conclusion on device deals: Both plans allow phone upgrades with trade-in credits, but Unlimited Ultimate guarantees eligibility for the very best promotions (flagship launches, max credits, etc.). Unlimited Welcome will get you some deals, but if you’re a phone enthusiast who upgrades frequently to the newest devices with big discounts, the Ultimate plan is the safer bet to always qualify ￼.

Bundling Benefits (Home Internet, Accessories, etc.)

Verizon offers several bundling and discount programs that either plan can take advantage of, though the extent of savings differs:
	•	Mobile + Home Internet Discount: As noted earlier, having a Verizon Unlimited plan makes you eligible for a $25/month discount on Verizon Home Internet service (such as Fios Gigabit, 5G Home, or LTE Home) ￼ ￼. This benefit applies equally to Unlimited Welcome and Unlimited Ultimate – both are “Unlimited 5G plans” that qualify for the discount. So, if you pair either plan with Verizon home internet (with autopay on both), you can get the home internet as low as $35/month (if its base price is $60) ￼ ￼. There is no extra advantage here for Ultimate over Welcome; the savings is the same $25 on home internet.
However, Unlimited Ultimate users might find it easier to capitalize on the “Perks on Us” promo Verizon has for some home internet customers. Specifically, Verizon has offered that if you have certain home internet plans (like 5G Home Ultimate) and a mobile line with a paid perk, you get a $10 credit towards that perk ￼. This effectively can make one $10 perk free. This offer isn’t tied strictly to Ultimate or Welcome, but having the top-tier 5G Home (called 5G Home Ultimate) and a mobile perk triggers it ￼. So indirectly, an Ultimate (mobile) user with Ultimate (home internet) could benefit by getting, say, Disney+ on the house.
	•	Connected Device Plan Discounts: Unlimited Ultimate includes 50% off up to two connected device lines (like watches, tablets) ￼. Unlimited Welcome includes no such discount on accessory lines. For someone with, e.g., an Apple Watch with cellular ($10/month normally) and a tablet line ($20/month normally), Unlimited Ultimate would halve the cost of those plans (saving ~$15/month total) ￼. Unlimited Welcome would provide no discount. Note: Unlimited Plus offers 50% off one device line ￼ ￼, and older Welcome Unlimited had no discounts and even limited adding some devices. So Ultimate is best if you have multiple gadgets on your account.
	•	Loyalty & Employer/Group Discounts: Verizon extends certain monthly discounts to customers who are military members/veterans, first responders, nurses, teachers, or students. These typically reduce the bill by e.g. $10 or $25 depending on number of lines (for 2+ lines) ￼. Both Unlimited Welcome and Unlimited Ultimate qualify for these program discounts as they are “5G Unlimited” plans ￼. (In the past, the old Welcome Unlimited was excluded from some employer/association discounts, but under the new myPlan structure, Verizon appears to allow it. The official support mentions these group discounts in context of Unlimited Ultimate ￼ but in practice Welcome can also receive them since it’s a current unlimited plan – albeit the discount amount might be smaller on single-line accounts.) In any case, Ultimate doesn’t get more of a discount than Welcome; the discount is based on number of lines and affiliation, not which unlimited tier you have.
	•	Bundle with Verizon Credit Card: Both plans can stack with Verizon Visa Card perks (like extra cash back on Verizon bills, or the card’s travel pass credits, etc.), but that’s outside the plan itself. It’s worth noting that Verizon Visa gives TravelPass credits that Ultimate users might not need (since they have free roaming) but Welcome users might value. This isn’t a direct plan benefit, but a financial perk.

Overall, bundling benefits are similar across both plans except for the connected device discounts: Unlimited Ultimate clearly offers more value if you have add-on lines (watches, tablets) or want to maximize perks credits. For home internet savings and affiliation discounts, both plans are eligible equally.

Pricing Differences

Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome is designed to be the budget-friendly option, whereas Unlimited Ultimate commands a premium price. Here’s a breakdown of pricing (assuming the $10 autopay discount is applied, as Verizon’s advertised prices typically include it):
	•	Unlimited Welcome: $55/month for a single line with autopay ￼. The cost per line drops significantly as you add lines – e.g. ~$50 each for 2 lines ($100 total), ~$35 each for 3 lines (around $105 total), and $25 each for 4 lines ($100 total) ￼. That makes four lines of Unlimited Welcome about $100/month (plus taxes/fees), which is an aggressive price (roughly on par with some competitor basic plans). These prices reflect a 3-year price guarantee as well – Verizon will not raise the base plan rate for at least three years ￼. It’s worth noting these rates require enrollment in autopay/paper-free billing (without autopay, add $10 per line).
	•	Unlimited Ultimate: $70/month for a single line with autopay ￼. Multi-line pricing: about $65 each for 2 lines ($130 total), $50 each for 3 lines ($150 total), and $40 each for 4 lines ($160 total) ￼. So, a family of four on Ultimate would pay roughly $160/month (before taxes/fees). This is a substantial difference from $100/month for four lines of Welcome. You are paying a premium for the extra features. Verizon also guarantees the price for 3 years on Ultimate ￼.

In absolute terms, a single Ultimate line costs ~$15 more than a single Welcome line per month ($70 vs $55 with autopay). For four lines, Ultimate is ~$60 more per month ($160 vs $100). Whether the added features are “worth” the price depends on your needs:
	•	If you value top data speeds, lots of hotspot, and global roaming, the extra cost can easily be justified by avoiding international fees and getting more utility out of your plan.
	•	If you primarily need basic unlimited data in the U.S. at the lowest cost, Welcome is significantly cheaper and might suffice.

Verizon permits mixing and matching plans on one account, which is a way to manage cost. For example, one heavy-use line could be on Ultimate while others are on Welcome or Plus – all lines still get the multi-line discount benefit determination ￼ ￼. The ability to mix myPlan tiers means a family can choose Ultimate for those who need the perks and Welcome for those who don’t, optimizing both features and cost.

Pro Tip: Both plans’ prices can be reduced by the typical $10/line autopay discount (included above) and any applicable employer/loyalty discounts (e.g. military, teacher – up to $25 off for accounts with 2+ lines) ￼. Also, Verizon often runs “Bring Your Own Device” credits or switching credits (e.g. $540 Verizon gift card for bringing your phone) on Unlimited plans ￼. These promotions are usually applicable to any postpaid unlimited plan; Unlimited Plus/Ultimate sometimes get the largest credits, but Welcome users have also gotten bill credits for switching with their own device ￼.

In summary, Unlimited Welcome is the more affordable choice and is one of Verizon’s cheapest ways to get unlimited data on the 5G network ￼. Unlimited Ultimate is significantly pricier but bundles in many extras that might save you money elsewhere (like included roaming instead of TravelPass fees, or included hotspot instead of a separate hotspot device/plan).

Other Exclusive Perks and Notes

Finally, a few additional perks and distinctions to note:
	•	3-Year Price Lock: Both Unlimited Welcome and Unlimited Ultimate come with a “3-year price lock guarantee”, meaning Verizon guarantees not to raise your plan’s base monthly rate for at least three years from when you started it ￼. This applies to all myPlan tiers (Welcome, Plus, Ultimate) ￼. Important: This price lock covers the plan fee, but not taxes, government fees, or add-on perk prices – those could change. It also resets if you change your plan or add a new line (then a new 3-year clock starts) ￼ ￼. The older “Welcome Unlimited” (pre-myPlan) did not have this guarantee, but the current plans do ￼.
	•	Free Satellite Messaging: Both plans advertise “free satellite messaging” as a feature ￼ ￼. This refers to Verizon’s support for devices that can send texts via satellite when no cellular signal is available. For instance, certain new smartphones (like the iPhone 14/15 series) can send emergency or short text messages over satellite. Verizon does not charge for these satellite texts – it’s included in all current unlimited plans as a safety feature ￼ ￼. (This is not a day-to-day service, just an emergency fallback; the phrase appears in plan benefit lists to reassure customers that the carrier isn’t charging extra for the phone’s satellite capability.)
	•	Verizon Cloud Storage & Security Apps: Verizon sometimes includes  cloud storage or the Smart Family app in plan perks. In myPlan, these are not default perks; they could be added as paid perks or separate services. Neither Welcome nor Ultimate automatically includes Verizon Cloud storage or Verizon Smart Family premium – those would be separate add-ons (often $5-$10). In older plans, top tiers had 600GB Cloud, etc., but that’s no longer bundled.
	•	Verizon Home Device Protect / Insurance Perk: Device protection is separate from the service plan. Both plan customers can purchase insurance or Verizon Home device protect, but Ultimate doesn’t include it for free. It’s equal footing here.
	•	“Ultimate” Experience Extras: Verizon markets that Unlimited Ultimate gives access to “experiences from our exclusive 5G partners: Snapchat+, Live Nation, Riot Games and Niantic” ￼. These are promotional tie-ins (e.g. early ticket access via Live Nation, AR games bonuses, etc.) available in Ultra Wideband areas. While not core plan features, they’re small perks Ultimate users might see in the Verizon app. Welcome users, without UW, wouldn’t have these particular 5G experience perks.
	•	Plan Flexibility: Both plans allow adding or removing the monthly perks freely and even switching between plans (the myPlan system is flexible since there are no contracts apart from device promos). If a Welcome user finds they need more hotspot or travel benefits, they can switch to Ultimate or Plus any time via My Verizon without penalty ￼.
	•	Plan Eligibility for Lines: All smartphone lines can choose either plan. Even basic phones or 4G devices can use these plans (you just won’t get 5G on a 4G phone) ￼. So, for a flip phone line, you could technically pick Welcome or Ultimate, but obviously the flip phone won’t leverage 5G UW or hotspot – so Welcome would be more cost-effective there.

In conclusion, Unlimited Ultimate offers every perk Verizon has – truly unlimited premium data, massive hotspot, included global roaming, higher video quality, device upgrade guarantees, and accessory discounts – at a steep price. Unlimited Welcome strips the plan to the essentials – unlimited talk/text/data with basic 5G – to keep costs low, omitting extras like hotspot and international use beyond North America. Customers should choose based on what matters to them: cost savings (Unlimited Welcome for a basic, no-frills unlimited plan ￼) vs. ultimate features (Unlimited Ultimate for a top-tier, worry-free experience with all the bells and whistles included ￼ ￼). Both plans can form part of a mix-and-match family plan, and both are protected by Verizon’s 3-year rate guarantee, ensuring stability in pricing. By understanding the differences outlined above, you can decide which plan aligns best with your needs – whether it’s the budget-friendly simplicity of Welcome or the feature-packed Ultimate plan with everything unlimited.
