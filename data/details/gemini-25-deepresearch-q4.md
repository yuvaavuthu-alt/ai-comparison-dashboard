# Forensic Billing Audit and Cost-Reduction Analysis: Account 489944906-00001

## Section 1: Executive Summary & Six-Month Account Dashboard

### 1.1 Overview of Findings

This report provides a forensic analysis of the six provided Verizon Wireless invoices, spanning the billing periods from April 29, 2025, to October 28, 2025. The analysis was conducted to identify month-by-month charges per line, isolate all non-recurring fees and subscriptions, and formulate a strategic plan for cost reduction.

The audit reveals an account in a precarious state. While the account benefits from an exceptionally deep and complex stack of non-standard loyalty and device-specific discounts, its financial stability is undermined by a critical, systemic billing error. An apparent configuration flaw in the account's Auto Pay system is causing a persistent "Unpaid balance" to carry over and compound monthly.

This core issue is being actively masked by large, non-recurring, manual "shadow credits" applied at the account level, likely by customer service agents in response to billing complaints. These temporary credits create a misleadingly low "Balance from last bill," hiding the true accumulating debt.

The primary recommendations focus on immediately correcting this systemic payment failure to prevent future penalties, strategically optimizing the account's plan mix for immediate savings, and preparing a long-term negotiation strategy to address the inevitable "discount cliff" when over $100.00 in monthly credits are scheduled to expire.

### 1.2 Your Six-Month Financial Snapshot (May - October 2025)

- **Total Six-Month Billed Charges: $2,315.14**  
  (Represents the sum of "This month's charges" from all six invoices)

- **Total Unpaid Balances Carried Forward: $283.86**  
  (Represents the sum of all "Unpaid balance" charges itemized in the detailed billing pages across the six-month period)

- **Total One-Time Fees Identified: $52.00**  
  (Comprising one $12.00 TravelPass charge and one $40.00 Activation Fee)

- **Total Non-Standard "Shadow Credits" Identified: -$225.00**  
  (Comprising -$185.00 in "Cellular Service - Access" credits and one -$40.00 "Activation Fee" waiver, all applied manually at the account level)

### 1.3 Summary of Urgent Recommendations

1. **Immediate (High Priority):** The Auto Pay configuration must be corrected immediately. The setting must be changed from its current state (presumed to be "Pay This Month's Charges") to **"Pay Total Amount Due."** This will resolve the recurring unpaid balances and prevent potential 5% late fees, which the account is currently exposed to.

2. **Strategic (High Impact):** A usage audit must be performed on the four lines currently subscribed to the premium "Unlimited Plus" plan. Downgrading these lines to the standard "Unlimited Welcome" plan, if high-end features are not required, represents the single largest and most immediate opportunity for monthly savings.

3. **Long-Term (Critical):** The account's low cost is highly dependent on temporary discounts. A "Discount Cliff" is projected for mid-2026, primarily **June 28, 2026**, when at least five major loyalty discounts are set to expire simultaneously, increasing the bill by a minimum of $50.00 per month. A proactive retention strategy must be prepared.

## Section 2: Comprehensive Six-Month Charge Analysis (May 2025 - October 2025)

This section provides the consolidated, line-by-line breakdown of all charges as requested.

### 2.1 Analysis of Account Evolution

A primary driver of billing complexity is the account's growth. The account expanded from **8 active lines** in the May 2025 billing period to **11 active lines** by the September 2025 billing period.

This expansion included:

- **June 2025:** The addition of lines 317-938-0409 and 463-724-9854.

- **September 2025:** The addition of line 716-346-7018, which incurred a $40.00 "Activation fee". This fee was subsequently contested and credited back in the October 2025 bill.

This growth, with lines being added mid-cycle, contributes to billing unpredictability and is a likely catalyst for the Auto Pay desynchronization detailed in Section 3. Further confusion is added by line names changing; for example, line 317-938-0409 is listed as "Raghav Singamshetty" in June but as "Sai Srilekha Aluru" in September.

### 2.2 Table: Month-over-Month Total Charges per Line (May - October 2025)

The following table synthesizes the "Bill summary by line" tables and de-anonymizes the "Remaining lines" totals by using the itemized "Charges by line details" pages from all six invoices. This provides a complete historical view of all 11 lines on the account.

| **Phone Number** | **User / Device** | **May 2025** | **June 2025** | **July 2025** | **Aug 2025** | **Sept 2025** | **Oct 2025** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Account-Level** | Account-wide charges | -$30.00 | -$30.00 | $6.30 | $6.93 | -$62.37 | -$41.00 |
| 317-407-1576 | Divya Lingireddy | $31.50 | $21.37 | $21.35 | $21.35 | $21.73 | $4.42 |
| 317-414-3245 | Chandresh Reddy Sura | $58.66 | $48.54 | $48.53 | $48.53 | $48.90 | $48.92 |
| 317-626-9963 | Abhishek | $67.05 | $56.92 | $56.90 | $56.90 | $57.28 | $57.30 |

| 317-938-0409 | Raghav / Sai Srilekha | N/A | $50.05 | $45.19 | $55.25 | $55.59 | $38.29 |
| 317-955-9654 | Divya / Archita | $36.50 | $39.31 | $52.80 | $37.06 | $37.08 | $34.93 |
| 463-724-9854 | Raghav / Ashwin | N/A | $24.05 | $40.71 | $45.98 | $15.32 | $39.42 |

*Note: Totals represent the final charge per line, including all plan costs, device payments, fees, taxes, and discounts. "N/A" indicates the line was not active on the account during that billing period.*

## Section 3: Forensic Audit of Non-Recurring Charges & Billing Discrepancies

This section addresses the request for a list of one-time charges and provides a forensic analysis of the account's primary billing irregularities.

### 3.1 CRITICAL FINDING: The Systemic Auto Pay Failure

The most significant finding of this audit is a persistent failure of the Auto Pay system. Despite the "You have Auto Pay scheduled" notification on every invoice, the account has been marked "Your bill is overdue" for at least three consecutive months.

The Auto Pay debit is consistently paying an incorrect amount, failing to cover the "Total Amount Due" and creating a compounding "Unpaid balance."

- **Evidence from July 2025 Bill:**
  - The "Total due on Jul 20" from the June bill was **$376.11**.
  - The July bill shows "You paid $289.18".
  - This created an **$86.93** shortfall, which appears as a debit charge: "Unpaid balance (May 29 Jun 28)" on the July bill's detailed charges.

- **Evidence from August 2025 Bill:**
  - The "Total due on Aug 20" from the July bill was **$441.13**.
  - The August bill shows "You paid $404.20".
  - This created a **$36.93** shortfall, which appears as a debit charge: "Unpaid balance (Jun 29 Jul 28)" on the August bill's detailed charges.

- **Evidence from September 2025 Bill:**
  - The "Total due on Sep 20" from the August bill was **$438.30**.
  - The September bill shows "You paid $404.96".
  - This created a **$33.34** shortfall, which appears as a debit charge: "Unpaid balance (Jul 29-Aug 28)" on the September bill's detailed charges.

- **Evidence from October 2025 Bill:**
  - The "Total due on Oct 20" from the September bill was **$400.26**.
  - The October bill shows "You paid $273.60".
  - This created a **$126.66** shortfall, which appears as a debit charge: "Unpaid balance (Aug 29 Sep 28)" on the October bill's detailed charges.

This pattern is not a user error in making a late payment; it is a systemic configuration error in which Auto Pay is debiting an amount *other* than the full balance due. This exposes the account to the 5% (or $7) late fee explicitly warned of on every invoice.

### 3.2 HIDDEN PATTERN: The "Shadow Credits" Masking the Problem

The Auto Pay failure is being dangerously obscured by a contradictory set of entries. While the detailed "Charges by line" pages clearly show large *unpaid balances* (debits), the front-page "Snapshot of your bill" shows a *credit* balance from the previous bill (e.g., "Balance from last bill -$32.37"; "Balance from last bill -$11.00").

This discrepancy is resolved by auditing the "Account-wide charges & credits" section. The front-page balance is a *net* figure. The true unpaid balance is being offset by massive, unexplained, one-time credits, which are almost certainly manual entries from a customer service or retention agent.

- **Evidence of "Shadow Credits":**
  - **July 2025 Bill:** A **-$50.00** credit for "Cellular Service - Access".
  - **September 2025 Bill:** A **-$65.00** credit for "Cellular Service - Access".
  - **October 2025 Bill:** A **-$70.00** credit for "Cellular Service - Access".

These are not standard discounts. These are large, lump-sum credits applied to offset the growing unpaid balance and other disputed charges. This indicates that the account is being "propped up" by temporary, manual interventions. When these manual credits stop, the bill will increase, and the underlying Auto Pay failure will cause the unpaid balance to escalate rapidly.

### 3.3 Log of One-Time Charges and Add-On Subscriptions

This log addresses the second part of the user's request, itemizing all non-recurring charges and subscriptions found in the six-month audit.

- **One-Time Charges:**
  - **July 2025 Bill:** A **$12.00** charge was applied to line 317-955-9654 for **"TravelPass India 1 day (Jul 21)"**.
  - **September 2025 Bill:** A **$40.00 "Activation fee"** was applied for the new line 716-346-7018.

- **One-Time Credits (Related to Charges):**
  - **October 2025 Bill:** A **-$40.00 "Activation Fee" credit** was applied at the account level. This directly corresponds to the fee charged in September, confirming it was successfully disputed and waived.
  - **October 2025 Bill:** A **-$7.33 "Loyalty discount" partial credit** was applied to line 317-407-1576. This indicates a new discount was added mid-billing cycle, further reinforcing the pattern of active, manual account adjustments.

- **Recurring Add-On Subscriptions:**
  - After a forensic review of all 11 lines across all 6 bills, there is **no evidence** of any recurring, paid add-on subscriptions (e.g., Disney Bundle, Apple Music, etc.) that have a separate line-item cost. All costs are consolidated into the "Plan" and "Devices" sections.

## Section 4: Strategic Recommendations for Bill Reduction & Management

This section provides actionable recommendations to resolve the account's billing issues and secure long-term savings.

### 4.1 Recommendation 1 (Immediate Priority): Correct the Auto Pay Failure

The recurring "Unpaid balance" is the account's most urgent problem. This must be resolved immediately to prevent future penalties and billing instability.

- **Action:** Log into the My Verizon account holder profile and navigate to the Auto Pay settings.

- **Instruction:** The payment setting is likely configured to pay "This Month's Charges" or a fixed amount. This setting must be changed to **"Pay Total Amount Due."**

- **Justification:** This single change will ensure the automatic debit pulls the full balance shown on the invoice (e.g., "$339.32") rather than just the "This month's charges" amount (e.g., "$350.32"), which does not account for prior credits or balances. This will stop the "Unpaid balance" from appearing and eliminate the risk of late fees.

### 4.2 Recommendation 2 (High Impact): Optimize Your Plan Mix

The account currently utilizes three different plan tiers: Unlimited Plus (premium), Unlimited Welcome (basic), and 5G Start (legacy/basic). The most significant and immediate monthly savings opportunity is in downgrading "Unlimited Plus" lines that do not require premium features (e.g., 30GB of premium hotspot data, 50GB of premium mobile data).

- **Action:** Conduct a usage audit on the following four lines currently subscribed to the more expensive "Unlimited Plus" plan:
  - Chandresh Reddy Sura (317-414-3245)
  - Divya Lingireddy (317-671-3776)
  - Swathi Vangala (317-717-0836)
  - Yuva Raja Reddy (716-910-7802)

- **Recommendation:** If these users do not regularly use the premium data or hotspot features, they should be downgraded to the "Unlimited Welcome" plan. This change can be made instantly via the My Verizon app.

- **Potential Savings:** Approximately **$40.00 per month** (based on a typical $10 per-line price difference between the "Plus" and "Welcome" tiers).

### 4.3 Recommendation 3 (Long-Term Strategy): Prepare for the "Discount Cliff"

This audit reveals that the account's low monthly cost is artificially suppressed by a complex stack of temporary promotional, loyalty, and device credits. The single greatest financial risk to this account is the future expiration of these discounts, which will cause a sudden and significant increase in the total bill.

The following table provides a consolidated schedule of all major expiring discounts. This schedule is critical for proactive financial planning.

**Table: Schedule of Expiring Promotional Discounts**

| **Discount** | **Line(s) Affected** | **Monthly Value** | **Expiration Date (Est.)** | **Source(s)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Loyal $10 for 12 MO** | 317-407-1576 | -$10.00 | **June 28, 2026** | 1 |
| **Loyal $10 for 12 MO** | 317-414-3245 | -$10.00 | **June 28, 2026** | 1 |
| **Loyal $10 for 12 MO** | 317-626-9963 | -$10.00 | **June 28, 2026** | 1 |
| **Loyal $10 for 12 MO** | 317-671-3776 | -$10.00 | **June 28, 2026** | 1 |
| **Loyal $10 for 12 MO** | 317-717-0836 | -$10.00 | **June 28, 2026** | 1 |
| **Device Promo Credit** | 317-671-3776 | -$19.99 | ~ November 2026 (Credit 25 of 36) | 1 |
| **Device Promo Credit** | 317-414-3245 | -$19.99 | ~ December 2026 (Credit 24 of 36) | 1 |
| **Device Promo Credit** | 317-717-0836 | -$19.99 | ~ December 2026 (Credit 22 of 36) | 1 |
| **Loyalty discount $10** | 317-407-1576 | -$10.00 | **October 06, 2026** | 1 |
| **Loyalty discount $10** | 317-938-0409 | -$10.00 | **October 06, 2026** | 1 |
| **Trade-In Device Promo** | 716-910-7802 | -$23.05 | ~ January 2027 (Credit 22 of 36) | 1 |
| **Bring Your Own Device** | 317-407-1576 | -$5.00 | ~ June 2027 (Credit 20 of 36) | 1 |
| **Bring Your Own Device** | 317-835-1874 | -$5.00 | ~ September 2027 (Credit 17 of 36) | 1 |
| **Bring Your Own Device** | 716-346-7018 | -$30.00 | ~ August 2028 (Credit 1 of 36) | 1 |

- **Strategic Advice:** The most critical date is **June 28, 2026**. On this date, five loyalty discounts will expire, potentially increasing the bill by **$50.00 per month overnight**. The account holder must call Verizon's retention department in May or early June 2026 to negotiate an extension or a new set of discounts, using the 11-line, high-value account as leverage.

### 4.4 Recommendation 4 (Verification): Confirm All Discounts Are Applied

- **Auto Pay Discount:** The "Auto Pay and paper-free billing discount" is correctly applied to all lines. However, the value of this discount *differs by plan*.
  - The Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome plans correctly receive the full **-$10.00** discount.
  - The legacy 5G Start plan (line 463-724-9854) correctly receives only a **-$5.00** discount. This is not an error but is a feature of that older plan.

- **Account-Level Discount:** The account receives a **"VALUED CUSTOMER $30 DISC 4 PH"**. This is a powerful, non-standard discount. In any future negotiations with customer service, this discount should be mentioned as a key component of the account's loyalty, and its removal should be resisted.
