## Question
I am using unlimited welcome plan in Verizon and want to switch to unlimited ultimate. Could you please provide all the perks and benefits I will get from this top tier plan?

## AI Response

Here's what you gain by moving from Verizon's Unlimited Welcome plan to the Unlimited Ultimate plan – Verizon's most feature‑rich consumer plan. Each benefit below comes from Verizon's current plan documentation and third‑party analyses.

### High‑performance network & data

- **Premium 5G Ultra Wideband (UWB) access and truly unlimited smartphone data.** The plan gives you Verizon's fastest 5G UWB and 5G/4G LTE access with no deprioritization. It includes unlimited premium data on the device and unlimited mobile‑hotspot use; however, after 200 GB of high‑speed hotspot data in a billing cycle, hotspot speeds are reduced to 6 Mbps ￼. By comparison, the Unlimited Welcome plan has no premium data and offers no included hotspot data (you can buy 100 GB of hotspot data separately) ￼.

- **Enhanced video streaming and video calling.** Unlimited Ultimate supports 4K Ultra‑HD streaming when you're on 5G UWB and 1080p HD streaming on 5G/4G LTE; if you don't turn on this feature in My Verizon, the default is 720p (UWB) or 480p (5G/4G) ￼. It also includes enhanced video calling and free satellite messaging ￼. The Welcome plan limits streaming to 480p SD ￼.

### International travel & calling benefits

- **Unlimited data, talk and text in 210 + countries.** Unlimited Ultimate users get unlimited international data, calls and texts in 210 + destinations; after 15 GB of high‑speed data, speeds slow to about 1.5 Mbps ￼. In Canada and Mexico you receive 2 GB of high‑speed data per day (then unlimited 3G speeds) plus unlimited talk and text ￼.

- **Unlimited calling & texting back home.** The plan includes unlimited international calling and texting within a visited country and back to the U.S. ￼ and unlimited calls from the U.S. to Mexico and Canada ￼.

- **Global Choice international calling minutes.** You can designate one of ~140 countries and get up to 300 calling minutes from the U.S. to that country each month, with discounted rates thereafter ￼. You can still text to 210 + countries from the U.S. ￼.

### Connected‑device & home‑internet savings

- **Discounts on connected devices.** Each Unlimited Ultimate line is eligible for up to two 50 %‑off connected‑device plans (watch, tablet, laptop, hotspot or Hum). Other qualifying unlimited plans only get one discounted device plan ￼.

- **Mobile + Home Discount.** If you bundle a home‑internet plan with your Unlimited Ultimate line, Verizon gives you a $15/month discount on your home‑internet bill, a credit of up to $10/month for an eligible perk (such as Apple One or Netflix & HBO Max) and priority customer support.

### Device upgrades & price stability

- **Ultimate Phone Upgrade Guarantee.** Lines on Unlimited Ultimate qualify for Verizon's best "in‑market" smartphone offers with trade‑in when you upgrade or add a line ￼. After your device is paid off or after 36 months, you can again access Verizon's top device deals ￼.

- **Three‑year price‑lock guarantee.** The voice/text/data portion of your plan is locked in for three years; the guarantee resets when you add lines ￼ ￼.

### Plan perks & optional add‑ons

- **Customize your plan with $10/month perks.** Unlimited Ultimate lines can add optional perks such as Apple One, Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ bundle, Netflix & Max (with ads), 3 TravelPass days, Google AI Pro, 100 GB mobile hotspot, Verizon Family Plus, second number, unlimited cloud storage and others ￼. You pay only for the perks you select, and you can change them monthly.

- **Mobile + Home perk credit.** If you qualify for the Mobile + Home discount and have a premium home‑internet plan, Verizon will cover up to $10/month of one of these paid perks.

### Additional benefits & discounts

- **Auto‑pay discount.** Enrolling in auto pay and paper‑free billing with a bank account or Verizon Visa® gives a $10/line/month discount ￼.

- **Special discounts.** Additional savings are available for first responders, military/veterans, nurses, teachers and students ￼.

- **Home Internet savings & bundle deals.** Verizon sometimes offers limited‑time promotions when you bundle mobile and home internet service.

- **Free satellite messaging.** Included free messaging via satellite can keep you connected when out of cellular range ￼.

### Summary

Upgrading to Unlimited Ultimate transforms your plan from a basic unlimited offering to Verizon's top‑tier package. You'll get unlimited premium data, far more hotspot data, built‑in international roaming, the ability to stream in 4K/HD, steep discounts on connected devices, home‑internet savings, a locked‑in price for three years and Verizon's best device upgrade offers. On top of that, you can customize the plan with optional perks (streaming, travel, extra hotspot data) and take advantage of special discounts and promotional credits.
