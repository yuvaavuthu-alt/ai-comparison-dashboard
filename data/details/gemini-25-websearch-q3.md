Based on current promotions available around the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, here are the best Verizon deals for bundling four unlimited wireless lines with home internet to maximize your household savings.

The primary way to maximize savings is by combining Verizon's "myPlan" for mobile with a "myHome" internet plan (either Fios or 5G Home).

### **Core Bundle Savings**

You can "stack" these discounts to get the lowest price:

* **Mobile + Home Discount:** You get a discount of **$15/month off your home internet bill** when you have both a qualifying postpaid mobile plan and a Fios or 5G Home Internet plan.
* **Auto Pay & Paper-Free Billing:** You save an additional **$10/month** on your bill by enrolling in Auto Pay and paper-free billing.

### **Best Plan Pricing for 4 Lines + Home Internet**

To maximize savings for four lines, your best option is the **Unlimited Welcome** plan.

* **Wireless:** The **Unlimited Welcome** plan can be as low as **$25 to $30 per line** for four lines (with Auto Pay and the 4-line discount). This would bring your total monthly mobile cost to approximately **$100-$120**.
* **Home Internet (with Bundle Discount):**
    * **Fios Home Internet:** If Fios is available at your address, new customers can find promotional pricing for the 300 Mbps plan for as low as **$20/month** (with Auto Pay, the Mobile + Home discount, and a 3-year bonus discount).
    * **5G Home Internet:** If Fios is not available, 5G Home Internet plans start at **$35/month** when bundled with a mobile plan.

This means a household with four unlimited lines and home internet could have a total monthly bill starting as low as **$120 to $155** (e.g., $100 for mobile + $20 for Fios, or $120 for mobile + $35 for 5G Home), plus any taxes and fees.

### **Major Holiday Perks & Promotions**

This is where you can get significant added value. The best perks are often tied to new internet sign-ups or the "myPlan" perk system.

**1. New Home Internet Customer Gift:**
As a new customer signing up for a qualifying home internet plan (like Fios 1 Gig, Fios 2 Gig, or 5G Home Ultimate), you can typically choose one high-value gift from the following:

* **Samsung 43" QLED TV**
* **Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G**
* **Nintendo Switch**

**2. Streaming & Service Perks (via "myPlan" and "myHome")**
Verizon's plans allow you to add or swap perks for a flat fee (usually **$10/month per perk**), which is often a significant discount on the retail price. Popular perks include:

* **Streaming:**
    * **The Disney Bundle** (Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ with ads)
    * **Netflix & Max** (with ads)
    * **YouTube Premium**
    * **Apple Music Family**
* **Storage & Protection:**
    * **Unlimited Cloud Storage**
    * **Verizon Family Plus** (which includes device protection features)
* **"Perk on Us" Deal:** If you have a premium internet plan (like Fios 1 Gig) and also pay for a $10 perk on your mobile plan, Verizon will give you one $10 perk "on us," effectively making one of your perks free.

**3. Limited-Time Internet Perks:**
* **YouTube TV Discount:** Get **$20 off per month for 6 months** on a new YouTube TV subscription when you have a select home internet plan.
* **3-Year Price Guarantee:** Many mobile and home internet plans come with a 3-year price lock, so your base rate won't change.

**4. New Phone Deals:**
The holiday season is also a prime time for device deals. You will see offers like a "free iPhone 17," "Samsung Galaxy S25 on us," or "Google Pixel 10 on us." These deals typically require you to add a new line on a specific unlimited plan (like Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate) and may or may not require a trade-in.

To get the most savings, you should first check which Verizon Home Internet service (Fios or 5G Home) is available at your address, as this will determine your exact pricing and promotional eligibility.
