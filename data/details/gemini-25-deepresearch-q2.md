36-Month Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for 4-Line Family Plan with Two Flagship Upgrades
Report To: Verizon Family Plan Holder From: Senior Analyst, Consumer Technology & Telecommunications Date: November 17, 2025 Subject: 36-Month Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for 4-Line Family Plan with Two Flagship Upgrades

Section 1: Executive Summary: The Lowest 36-Month Cost Recommendation
This report provides a comprehensive 36-month total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis to determine the most cost-effective method for upgrading two lines on a four-line Verizon family plan to new 5G flagship smartphones. The analysis compares purchasing devices at full retail, using 36-month installment plans, and leveraging Verizon's current trade-in promotions.

Primary Recommendation: The 'Buy Outright & Decouple' Strategy

The lowest possible 36-month TCO is achieved by not participating in Verizon's 36-month promotional trade-in offers, which contractually bind the device to a specific service plan.

The winning financial strategy is a three-part approach:

Place all four family lines on Verizon's Unlimited Welcome plan. At $30 per line for four lines, this establishes the lowest possible monthly service cost of $120.   

Purchase the two new flagship devices at full retail price, either from Verizon or, preferably, unlocked directly from the manufacturer (e.g., Apple, Google).   

Sell the two existing "Tier 1" eligible trade-in phones on the private secondary market (e.g., Swappa, eBay), where their value will exceed Verizon's lowest promotional tier.

This strategy yields the lowest TCO by securing the cheapest available service plan ($4,320 over 36 months) and maximizing the capital return on the existing devices. Market data indicates a 2-year-old iPhone 15 Pro Max retains a trade-in value of $520 , a figure that is significantly higher than the promotional value offered on Verizon's cheapest plan.   

Runner-Up: The 'Best In-Carrier' Option

For families who prefer to finance the devices through their Verizon bill, the lowest-cost in-carrier option is not the "free phone" deal. The most cost-effective TCO is achieved by:

Placing all four lines on the Unlimited Welcome plan ($120/mo).

Accepting the minimal 36-month trade-in promotion associated with that plan, valued at approximately $360 to $400 per device.   

The Core Finding: Deconstructing the "Free Phone" Trap

This analysis definitively demonstrates that Verizon's high-value "free phone" promotions (e.g., "free iPhone 17" or "$1,100 off iPhone 17 Pro")  are a "false economy."   

These promotions are structured to create a net financial loss for the consumer over the 36-month contract period. To obtain a high-value promotional credit (e.g., $830 for an iPhone 17), Verizon mandates that the line be placed on a premium-priced service plan, such as Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate.   

The financial trap is simple: the 36-month increase in the monthly service plan cost is significantly greater than the additional promotional credit received.

Consider the math for upgrading two lines to the "free" iPhone 17:

The Deal: An $830 credit per phone, requiring two lines to be on the Unlimited Plus plan.   

The Cost of the Plan: The Unlimited Welcome plan costs $30/line. The Unlimited Plus plan costs $45/line. This is an extra $15 per month, per line.   

The 36-Month Premium: Over 36 months, the mandatory plan upgrade costs an additional $1,080 ($15 x 2 lines x 36 months).

The Extra Credit: The alternative is staying on Unlimited Welcome, which offers a $360 credit. The "free phone" deal provides an extra $470 in credit per line ($830 - $360), or $940 total for two lines.   

The Net Loss: To get that $940 in additional credit, the family must pay $1,080 in extra service fees. This is a net loss of $140. The family pays more over 36 months for the privilege of receiving the "free" phones. This report will prove this model holds true for all promotional scenarios.

Section 2: Deconstructing Your 36-Month Verizon Bill
To conduct an accurate TCO analysis, it is essential to isolate the four distinct financial components that constitute a Verizon bill when upgrading devices.

Component 1: Monthly Service Cost (The Baseline)
This is the recurring 30-day charge for wireless service (talk, text, and data) for all four lines on the account. This cost is determined by the specific 'myPlan' chosen for each line. As established in the Executive Summary, this is the single most significant cost variable and the primary lever carriers use to increase long-term customer revenue. This analysis will model costs for the Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, and Unlimited Ultimate plans.   

Component 2: Monthly Device Payments (The Hardware Cost)
When a customer does not pay the full retail price (FRP) upfront, Verizon finances the total cost of the hardware over a 36-month period at 0% APR. This monthly payment (e.g., $23.05/mo for an $829.99 iPhone 17)  is a fixed cost added to the monthly bill. It is, in effect, an interest-free loan for the hardware.   

Component 3: Monthly Promotional Credits (The "Deal")
This is the carrier's "deal" or "trade-in promotion." It is crucial to understand that this is not a lump-sum payment or a discount on the hardware itself. Instead, it is a recurring bill credit applied monthly over the same 36-month term.   

This mechanism creates what is known as the "golden handcuffs." The promotional credits are contingent on the customer remaining with Verizon, on the specific (and more expensive) qualifying plan, for the entire 36-month period. If the customer pays off the phone early, switches to a cheaper plan, or moves to another carrier, all remaining promotional credits are forfeited. This ensures Verizon recoups the cost of the promotion by locking in a 36-month revenue stream on a high-margin service plan.

Component 4: One-Time Fees (The Upfront Cost)
Verizon charges a one-time "Activation Fee" or "Upgrade Fee" for each new device activated on a line. This fee is consistently $40 per device across all promotional materials and device pages. For the two upgrades requested, this analysis will add a fixed, one-time cost of $80 to all scenarios involving in-carrier device financing or activation.   

Section 3: Analysis 1: The 4-Line 'myPlan' Service Cost (The 36-Month Baseline)
The foundation of the TCO model is the 36-month cost of the service plan itself, independent of any hardware. This cost varies significantly based on the plan mix.

Part 3.1: The 4-Line "Simple Bundle" Costs
These are the standard, advertised 4-line prices, assuming all four family members are on the identical plan. All prices assume the $10/line discount for Auto Pay and paper-free billing.   

Unlimited Welcome: $30 per line, per month.

Total Monthly Cost: $120.00    

Unlimited Plus: $45 per line, per month.

Total Monthly Cost: $180.00    

Unlimited Ultimate: $55 per line, per month.

Total Monthly Cost: $220.00    

Part 3.2: The "Expert" 4-Line Mix-and-Match Strategy
Verizon's 'myPlan' system is designed to allow mix-and-match capabilities, where each line on an account can have a different plan level. This is a critical factor, as only the two lines receiving promotional upgrades are required to be on a premium plan. The other two lines can remain on the cheapest plan, Unlimited Welcome, to minimize the total account cost.   

This "Mix-and-Match" approach is the most favorable possible configuration for testing the "free phone" deals. By using this optimized baseline, we are giving the carrier promotions their best possible chance to be cost-effective.

"Mix-and-Match Plus" (2x Unlimited Plus, 2x Unlimited Welcome):

(2 lines * $45/mo) + (2 lines * $30/mo) = $90 + $60

Total Monthly Cost: $150.00

"Mix-and-Match Ultimate" (2x Unlimited Ultimate, 2x Unlimited Welcome):

(2 lines * $55/mo) + (2 lines * $30/mo) = $110 + $60

Total Monthly Cost: $170.00

Part 3.3: 36-Month Service-Only TCO Comparison
This table establishes the baseline service-only cost over the 36-month analysis period. This "premium" is the cost that the promotional credits must overcome to be financially viable.

Table 1: 36-Month 4-Line Service Plan Total Cost of Ownership (Baseline)

Plan Configuration	Monthly Cost	36-Month TCO	36-Month Premium (vs. "All Welcome")
"All Welcome" (4x Welcome)	$120.00	$4,320.00	---
"Mix-and-Match Plus" (2x Plus, 2x Welcome)	$150.00	$5,400.00	+$1,080.00
"Mix-and-Match Ultimate" (2x Ultimate, 2x Welcome)	$170.00	$6,120.00	+$1,800.00
As Table 1 illustrates, opting for the "Mix-and-Match Plus" plan, which is necessary for most "free" base-model phones, costs the family an extra $1,080 over 36 months. Opting for the "Mix-and-Match Ultimate" plan, required for the best "Pro" model deals, costs an extra $1,800.

Section 4: Analysis 2: Flagship Device Pricing & The Promotional Value Matrix
This section synthesizes the hardware and promotional data into two foundational tables that will fuel the TCO models.

Part 4.1: Device Hardware Costs
This table establishes the baseline Full Retail Price (FRP) for each flagship device and its corresponding 36-month installment payment, which remains consistent regardless of the service plan selected.

Table 2: Verizon Flagship Device Full Retail Price (FRP) & 36-Month Installment Cost

Device Model	Full Retail Price (FRP)	36-Month Installment	Source(s)
iPhone 17	$829.99	$23.05/mo	
iPhone 17 Pro	$1,099.99	$30.55/mo	
iPhone 17 Pro Max	$1,199.99	$33.33/mo	
Samsung Galaxy S25	$799.99	$22.22/mo	
Samsung Galaxy S25+	$999.99	$27.77/mo	
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra	$1,299.99	$36.11/mo	
Google Pixel 10	$799.99	$22.22/mo	
Google Pixel 10 Pro	$999.99	$27.77/mo	
  
Part 4.2: The 36-Month Promotional Credit Matrix
This table is the "Rosetta Stone" of the analysis, mapping the 36-month promotional value for a single Tier 1 trade-in. It illustrates how the same trade-in phone receives a different value based on the plan selected and the phone being purchased.

This data, synthesized from Verizon and Best Buy's detailed trade-in offer pages, reveals the deliberate carrier strategy. The "Welcome" plan offers a low, flat-rate credit. The "Plus" plan offers a high-value credit, but it is capped at a level that typically covers the base-model phones (e.g., $830). The "Ultimate" plan is the only way to unlock the maximum promotional value (e.g., $1,100) required to fully cover the most expensive "Pro" or "Ultra" devices.   

Table 3: 36-Month Promotional Credit Matrix (Per Device, Tier 1 Trade-In)

New Device	Full Retail Price (FRP)	Promo on Unlimited Welcome	Promo on Unlimited Plus	Promo on Unlimited Ultimate
iPhone 17	$829.99

(Note: Pixel 10/Pro promotional values on Welcome/Plus are estimated based on the identical pricing structure of the Samsung S25/S25+ and available data.)

Section 5: Analysis 3: 36-Month TCO Modeling — The "Free Phone" Trap
This section applies the data from Sections 3 and 4 to model the 36-month TCO for a family of four upgrading two lines with two Tier 1 trade-ins.

Part 5.1: The TCO Formula
The formula used for all in-carrier installment scenarios is: (36-Month Service Cost) + (2 x Device FRP) + (2 x $40 Activation Fee) - (2 x Promotional Credit) = 36-Month TCO

Part 5.2: Scenario A: The "Base Model" Champions (2x iPhone 17)
This scenario models the TCO for upgrading to two base-model devices, such as the iPhone 17 or Samsung Galaxy S25.

As Table 3 shows, the maximum promotional value for these devices ($830 for the iPhone 17, $800 for the S25) is available on the Unlimited Plus plan. The Unlimited Ultimate plan offers no additional credit, making it a financially redundant and poor choice. Therefore, the "Free Phone" deal is modeled using the "Mix-and-Match Plus" plan, its most optimal configuration.

Model A1: The "Free Phone" Deal (2x iPhone 17 on "Mix-and-Match Plus")

Service Cost (Table 1): $5,400.00

Hardware (2 x $829.99): +$1,659.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Promo Credits (2 x $830): -$1,660.00

36-Month TCO (Model A1): $5,479.98

Model A2: The "Cheapest Plan" Deal (2x iPhone 17 on "All Welcome")

Service Cost (Table 1): $4,320.00

Hardware (2 x $829.99): +$1,659.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Promo Credits (2 x $360): -$720.00

36-Month TCO (Model A2): $5,339.98

Conclusion (Base Model): The "Cheapest Plan" strategy (Model A2) is $140.00 cheaper over 36 months than the "Free Phone" strategy (Model A1).

The financial breakdown is clear:

The "Free Phone" deal (Model A1) required paying $1,080 in extra service plan fees (the premium from Table 1).

In exchange, the family received only $940 in extra promotional credits ($1,660 in Model A1 minus $720 in Model A2).

This results in a net loss of $140 for the consumer.

Part 5.3: Scenario B: The "Premium Upgrade" (2x iPhone 17 Pro)
This scenario models the TCO for upgrading to two premium-tier devices, such as the iPhone 17 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

For these devices, the promotional tiers are distinct. The "Mix-and-Match Ultimate" plan is the only way to receive the maximum $1,100 promotional credit per device. This is the carrier's true high-margin target: compelling high-spending customers onto its most expensive service plan.   

Model B1: The "Max Promo" Deal (2x iPhone 17 Pro on "Mix-and-Match Ultimate")

Service Cost (Table 1): $6,120.00

Hardware (2 x $1,099.99): +$2,199.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Promo Credits (2 x $1,100): -$2,200.00

36-Month TCO (Model B1): $6,199.98

Model B2: The "Cheapest Plan" Deal (2x iPhone 17 Pro on "All Welcome")

Service Cost (Table 1): $4,320.00

Hardware (2 x $1,099.99): +$2,199.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Promo Credits (2 x $360): -$720.00

36-Month TCO (Model B2): $5,879.98

Conclusion (Pro Model): The "Cheapest Plan" strategy (Model B2) is $320.00 cheaper over 36 months than the "Max Promo" strategy (Model B1).

The financial trap is even more pronounced with premium devices:

The "Max Promo" deal (Model B1) required paying $1,800 in extra service plan fees (the premium from Table 1).

In exchange, the family received only $1,480 in extra promotional credits ($2,200 in Model B1 minus $720 in Model B2).

This results in a net loss of $320 for the consumer.

Section 6: Analysis 4: The 'Buy Full Price' Alternative (The Winning Strategy)
The models in Section 5 definitively prove that coupling a device promotion to a high-cost plan is a losing financial proposition. This section introduces the TCO-winning strategy: decoupling the hardware purchase from the service plan entirely.

Part 6.1: The 'Decoupling' Philosophy
By purchasing a phone outright (at full retail), the consumer is not bound by 36 months of recurring bill credits. This provides two immediate and significant financial advantages:

Plan Freedom: The family can place all four lines on the cheapest possible plan (Unlimited Welcome) without penalty.

Device Freedom: The device is unlocked , allowing the family to switch carriers at any time to pursue a better service deal.   

This strategy trades a long-term, locked-in monthly credit (the promotion) for an "upfront" liquid asset (the cash value of the old phone).

Part 6.2: Estimating Your Private Sale Value
Verizon's trade-in offers on the "Welcome" plan ($360-$400)  are not reflective of an old device's true market value; they are a lowball "floor" price.   

Recent market data from November 2025 shows that a 2-year-old iPhone 15 Pro Max retains a trade-in value of $520. This is a more realistic, albeit still conservative, baseline for a "Tier 1" device in good condition on the private market. For this analysis, a conservative value of $500 per phone will be used as the private sale value, for a total of $1,000 for the two traded devices.   

Part 6.3: TCO Model C: The "Buy Full Price & Sell Private" Strategy
This model uses the "All Welcome" service plan (the cheapest) and subtracts the liquid cash value from the private sale of the old phones.

Model C1: (2x iPhone 17 on "All Welcome" + Private Sale)

Service Cost (Table 1): $4,320.00

Hardware (2 x $829.99): +$1,659.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Private Sale Credit (2 x $500): -$1,000.00

36-Month TCO (Model C1): $5,059.98

Model C2: (2x iPhone 17 Pro on "All Welcome" + Private Sale)

Service Cost (Table 1): $4,320.00

Hardware (2 x $1,099.99): +$2,199.98

Activation Fees (2 x $40): +$80.00

Private Sale Credit (2 x $500): -$1,000.00

36-Month TCO (Model C2): $5,599.98

These TCOs are substantially lower than any of the "in-carrier" promotional scenarios modeled in Section 5. This strategy is the clear financial winner.

Section 7: Final Recommendations and Comparative TCO
This section summarizes all findings into a final comparative table and provides a clear, actionable plan.

Part 7.1: The Final 36-Month TCO Comparison
This table ranks all modeled scenarios, providing a definitive comparison of all possible strategies. The results are conclusive: the "Buy Full Price / Sell Private" strategy is the lowest-cost option for both base-model and pro-model phones. The "Free Phone" deals, conversely, are the most expensive ways to acquire the new devices over 36 months.

Table 4: 36-Month Total Cost of Ownership (All Scenarios, 4 Lines, 2 Upgrades)

Strategy	Plan	2 New Phones	36-Month TCO	36-Mo Cost Rank
Buy Full Price / Sell Private	All Welcome	iPhone 17	$5,059.98	#1 (Lowest Cost)
Verizon Installment (Min. Promo)	All Welcome	iPhone 17	$5,339.98	#2
"Free Phone" Deal	Mix-and-Match Plus	iPhone 17	$5,479.98	#3
Buy Full Price / Sell Private	All Welcome	iPhone 17 Pro	$5,599.98	#4 (Lowest for Pro)
Verizon Installment (Min. Promo)	All Welcome	iPhone 17 Pro	$5,879.98	#5
"Max Promo" Deal	Mix-and-Match Ultimate	iPhone 17 Pro	$6,199.98	#6 (Highest Cost)
Part 7.2: Your Step-by-Step Action Plan (The Winning Strategy)
Based on this comprehensive financial analysis, the following step-by-step action plan will yield the lowest total cost of ownership over the next 36 months.

Do Not trade the existing phones in to Verizon or accept any 36-month promotional deal.

Log in to the My Verizon account and confirm that all four family lines are placed on the Unlimited Welcome plan. This will set the monthly service bill at $120.

Go to the manufacturer's store or website (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google) and purchase the two new flagship phones unlocked at full retail price. Payment can be made in full or via the manufacturer's own 0% APR financing, which also decouples the device from the Verizon service plan.   

When the new phones arrive, activate them on the two existing Verizon lines. This will incur a one-time $80 fee ($40 per line) on the next Verizon bill.   

Take the two old "Tier 1" phones, factory reset them, and list them for sale on a reputable private market (e.g., Swappa, eBay). Based on market data, a private sale value of $500 or more per device is achievable.   

Part 7.3: Critical Considerations & Final Expert Advice
While the financial models are clear, two critical exceptions must be considered.

The "Any Condition" Wildcard: Verizon's high-value promotions often accept trade-in phones in "any condition" (e.g., broken, cracked screen). The "Buy Full Price / Sell Private" strategy (Models C1 and C2) assumes the existing phones are in good condition and can command a value of $500. If the existing phones are damaged, their private sale value plummets to near $0. In this specific situation, the "Free Phone" deals (Models A1 and B1) become the most cost-effective TCO, as Verizon is accepting a valueless (or low-value) item in exchange for $830 to $1,100 in bill credits. The actual physical condition of the trade-in phones is the most important variable.   

The "Value of Service" Caveat: This analysis has been purely financial, assuming the "Unlimited Welcome" plan is sufficient for the family's needs. The premium plans (Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Ultimate) offer tangible, non-financial benefits, including premium network access (data is not slowed during congestion), significantly larger mobile hotspot data allowances , and international travel benefits. If the family frequently experiences network congestion or requires robust hotspot or international features, the $1,080 to $1,800 "premium" paid for these plans (from Table 1) may be a justifiable expense for a better quality of service. However, from a pure TCO perspective, they represent a net financial loss.   

The 36-Month Lock-In: By choosing the TCO-winning strategy, the family remains free and flexible. They are not contractually bound to Verizon for 36 months to receive the full value of a promotion. This flexibility has its own unquantifiable value, allowing the family to change plans or carriers at any time in response to better market offers.
