## Verizon Bundle Deals: Maximizing Holiday Savings for Four-Line HouseholdsVerizon's current bundle offerings for November-December 2025 deliver substantial savings for households with four unlimited lines and home internet. The combination of automatic discounts, promotional device bundles, and streaming perks creates excellent value across multiple budget tiers.

### Most Cost-Effective BundlesThe price range for complete wireless-plus-internet bundles spans from **$165 to $285 monthly**, depending on plan tier and technology choice:

| Bundle Combination | Monthly Cost | Best Use Case |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Unlimited Welcome + 5G Home Plus** | $165 | Budget-conscious households, light usage |
| **Unlimited Plus + Fios 1 Gig** | $244.99 | Balanced option (most recommended) |
| **Unlimited Plus + 5G Home Ultimate** | $240 | Medium households without Fios availability |
| **Unlimited Ultimate + Fios 1 Gig** | $284.99 | Premium option, maximum features |The $15 monthly Mobile + Home Discount applies automatically to 5G/LTE plans and can be manually enrolled for Fios customers through the My Verizon app. This translates to **$180 annually or $540 over three years** in direct savings.[1]
