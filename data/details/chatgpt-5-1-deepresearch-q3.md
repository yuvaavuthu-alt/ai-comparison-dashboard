# Best Verizon Mobile + Home Bundles for Holiday 2025

## Mobile + Home Bundle Savings & Perks

Verizon is running "Mobile + Home" bundle promotions this holiday season that reward customers who combine a wireless plan with Verizon home internet. By pairing your Verizon Unlimited mobile plan with either Fios or 5G Home Internet, you get $15 off your monthly home internet bill and one included perk (up to $10/month value) at no extra cost. In practice, this means you can enjoy a premium add-on for free – for example, the Disney+–Hulu–ESPN+ bundle (with ads) normally costs ~$21/month, but Verizon lets you add it as a $10 perk and then covers that $10 fee, saving you about $21 each month. Other popular perks include a Netflix & Max (HBO Max) bundle (ad-supported tiers) – normally about $17.98/month, available for $10 via Verizon (saving ~$8) – and even Apple One (Apple Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud+) which Verizon offers for $15 (about $5 off its regular price). You can choose one of these $10 perks free as part of the bundle deal, effectively getting a streaming or cloud service included. Verizon's new plans also feature a 3-year price lock on both the wireless and home internet service, so your base prices won't increase during that period. Plus, bundle customers receive priority customer support (faster access to reps) for extra peace of mind. In short, combining Verizon mobile with home internet not only knocks $15/month off your bill, but also scores your household free entertainment value and long-term price protection during the 2025 holiday promotions.

## Four Unlimited Wireless Lines – Holiday Deals

For a family or group that needs four unlimited phone lines, Verizon's holiday offers make it much more affordable. The Unlimited Welcome plan is Verizon's budget-friendly unlimited option, and normally four lines cost about $120/month (around $30 per line after multi-line discounts and autopay). This season, Verizon has a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) deal for switchers: if you bring your own compatible phones and activate four new lines, Verizon will credit you $180 per line over 36 months – effectively $5 off per line each month. That drops the cost of a 4-line Unlimited Welcome plan to roughly $100/month total, or about $25 per line. (Importantly, this BYOD credit doesn't require trading in phones, and even lets you keep your existing numbers when you switch.) If your family wants more premium service, Verizon's higher-tier plans are also discounted for multiple lines. The top-end Unlimited Ultimate plan, for instance, runs about $220/month for four lines (≈$55/line) under family pricing. That plan includes extras like 60 GB of high-speed mobile hotspot per line, full 5G Ultra Wideband speeds, and built-in international roaming (Unlimited Ultimate users get unlimited talk/text plus 10GB of data abroad each month, whereas cheaper plans would require using a TravelPass perk). You can also mix-and-match plans per line if needed – e.g. put some heavy-use lines on Ultimate and lighter-use ones on Welcome – but every line on a postpaid unlimited plan counts toward the Mobile + Home bundle discount. All Verizon unlimited plans support the $10 add-on perks (streaming services, cloud storage, etc.), so even the Welcome plan users can take advantage of the included free perk from the mobile+home bundle deal. In summary, four-line unlimited plans are on sale for the holidays – either via ~$25/line promotional pricing for switchers on the basic plan, or with multi-line discounts on the feature-rich plans – ensuring a cost-effective setup for your family's mobile service.

## Verizon Fios Home Internet Bundle Deals

If Verizon Fios fiber-optic internet is available in your area, the holiday bundle deals can yield huge savings on home internet. New Fios customers who also have a Verizon mobile plan can get Fios 300 Mbps for as low as $20 per month for the first 36 months. This deep discount stacks Verizon's standard $15 Mobile + Home loyalty discount with an additional $15/mo "holiday bonus" credit for 3 years. In other words, Verizon is essentially slicing $30 off the normal price for three years – making 300 Mbps fiber just $20/mo (with autopay) which is extremely competitive. Even the gigabit Fios plans are on sale: for example, Fios 1 Gig comes with a 3-year rate guarantee and qualifies for the same $15 bundle discount and bonus credits. While the 1 Gig plan isn't $20, it does unlock the season's best freebies. Verizon is giving away high-value electronics when you sign up for select top-tier home internet plans by the holidays. Specifically, new Fios Gigabit (or 2 Gig) customers can choose a free gift: options include a Samsung 43″ QLED 4K smart TV (worth ~$400), a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G tablet (~$500 value), or a Nintendo Switch console. These "on us" gifts are available if you activate a qualifying Fios plan (or 5G Home equivalent) and remain a customer for at least 60–180 days. Most Fios TV subscribers get a bonus as well – Verizon is offering a $200 Verizon Gift Card if you add the highest-tier Fios TV package when switching your internet over. The bottom line: a Fios fiber bundle can be incredibly cost-effective this season. For a household with Verizon wireless service, you could snag 300 Mbps Fios for $20/mo locked in for 3 years, or upgrade to a gigabit plan and score a free 43″ 4K smart TV or Nintendo Switch as a holiday reward for your subscription. All Fios plans also carry Verizon's multi-year price lock guarantee, so you won't see a surprise rate hike until well after the promotional period.

Verizon is offering a free 43″ Samsung QLED 4K TV (pictured) or other expensive gadget when you bundle a new Fios 1 Gig/2 Gig or 5G Home Ultimate plan with wireless service this holiday. New home internet customers can choose one free gift – TV, tablet, or Nintendo Switch – a promotion valued around $400–$500.

## Verizon 5G Home Internet Bundle Deals

For those without Fios availability, Verizon's 5G Home Internet (delivered via the 5G Ultra Wideband wireless network) is the next-best option – and it too has stellar holiday deals. The 5G Home Internet plans start at similar price points to Fios when bundled: the base 5G Home plan is typically $25/month with a Verizon mobile plan (or $35 standalone), and the higher-tier 5G Home Ultimate* plan is about *$35/month with a mobile plan (around $70 without) – pricing that often includes all taxes and fees. Like Fios, Verizon 5G Home Ultimate is eligible for the free gift bundle: new subscribers on the 5G Home Ultimate plan can pick a Samsung QLED TV (~$400 value), Nintendo Switch console, or Samsung Galaxy Tab FE tablet (~$500) as a free welcome gift. Verizon has been advertising a 5-year price guarantee for 5G Home plans, meaning if you lock it in now, your monthly rate is frozen for five years – a great long-term value. Additionally, Verizon is running a streaming promo for cord-cutters: if you switch to a qualifying home internet plan, you can get $20 off YouTube TV for 6 months (saving $120). This could be stacked with Verizon's own +play platform deals or the Disney+/Netflix perks from the bundle. Overall, Verizon's 5G Home + wireless bundle can yield comparable savings to Fios: you'll get the $15/month bundle discount on your internet bill, can claim an electronics freebie on the 5G Home "Ultimate" tier, and benefit from a long-term price lock. The 5G Home equipment (router/receiver) is plug-and-play, and Verizon often waives equipment fees and offers free setup as part of holiday specials. For a household looking to cut the cord or replace cable, the 5G Home bundle provides high-speed internet at $25–$35/month with generous promos – a very cost-effective solution when paired with Verizon's wireless service.

## Bonus Perks: Streaming, Cloud Storage & Protection

One major appeal of Verizon's holiday bundles is the array of perks that can be included, maximizing the value your family gets beyond just connectivity. As noted, the Mobile + Home deal gives you one free perk (up to $10/month) – typically an entertainment subscription. Verizon's perk program (available with their latest myPlan Unlimited plans and myHome internet plans) lets you add services at a discount. For example, you can choose the Disney Bundle (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ with ads) as your freebie – Verizon's price is $10 (vs. ~$21 retail), and the $10 credit makes it $0. If your household prefers different content, you might opt for Netflix + Max (both ad-supported) for free (Verizon's $10 bundle price saves ~$7 off buying them separately). Music lovers could pick Apple Music Family (Apple's family plan) for free ($10 value, normally $17), or gamers might choose Apple One – Verizon offers the full Apple One bundle for $15 (about $5 off) which includes Apple TV+, Music, Arcade, and iCloud+ – and you could apply your $10 credit toward it, effectively paying just $5 for Apple One. Aside from streaming, Verizon's add-ons also cover cloud storage and security. There's an Unlimited Verizon Cloud Storage perk ($10/month) that provides unlimited photo/video backup – you could alternatively use your free perk on this if keeping your family's data safe is a priority. Verizon's top plans also include some perks by default: Unlimited Ultimate comes with international TravelPass privileges (roughly 3 days of global roaming per month at no charge) included, whereas lower plans would pay $10 for that perk. It also includes 3-year device upgrade guarantees and other VIP benefits.

On the topic of device protection, it's not bundled free in these holiday deals, but you can add Verizon Mobile Protect insurance separately. Verizon Mobile Protect covers loss, theft, damage, and provides same-day device repairs/replacements and tech support. It costs about $16–$19 per month per phone (depending on device type), or you can cover multiple devices with a Multi-Device plan – roughly $50/month for 3 devices, or $60/month for 4–10 lines (covers any 3 concurrent claims). While it's an optional add-on, it may be worth it for a household with expensive new phones – especially since Verizon isn't offering it as a free perk. Keep an eye out though: Verizon sometimes waives the first month or offers enrollment promos, but as of the 2025 holiday season there's no widely advertised free device protection deal.

**Summary:** Verizon's Thanksgiving/Black Friday and Christmas promotions in 2025 present an excellent opportunity to maximize your household's savings by bundling four wireless lines with home internet. With the bundle, you're looking at significant monthly discounts (at least $15 off), 3–5 years of price guarantees, and the ability to enjoy premium streaming services on Verizon's dime. Whether you choose Fios fiber (with speeds up to 1–2 Gig) or 5G Home broadband, Verizon is sweetening the deal with hundreds of dollars in bonuses – from free smart TVs and tablets to $200 gift cards for Fios TV – making it one of the most cost-effective bundle offerings on the market this holiday season. All these deals can be found directly through Verizon's official holiday promotions page or trusted retailers, so you can confidently take advantage of them knowing they are legitimate. By combining four unlimited mobile lines and Verizon home internet under these promos, a family can save big on monthly bills, enjoy top-tier streaming perks, and even score free tech gadgets, achieving maximum value for the entire household.
