## 3. Recommendations to Lower Your Bill

### Resolve Overdue Payments
The most immediate issue is the "overdue" status on your July and August bills and the carried-over balances. You are enrolled in Auto Pay, but these balances suggest the payments may not be covering the full amount due. 

**Action:** To avoid potential 5% late fees and service disruption warnings, ensure your Auto Pay is set to pay the "Total due" amount each month.

### Review "Unlimited Plus" Plans
You have several lines on "Unlimited Plus", which is a more expensive plan than "Unlimited Welcome." For example, in the October bill, the base plan cost (before discounts) for Unlimited Plus is $55 versus $40 for Unlimited Welcome.

**Action:** Review the data and hotspot usage for lines (317-414-3245), (317-671-3776), (317-717-0836), and (716-910-7802). If they do not need the premium features of Unlimited Plus (like premium network access or larger high-speed hotspot allowances), you could save approximately $15 per line, per month by downgrading them to Unlimited Welcome.

### Monitor International Charges
You incurred one-time international charges in July, August, and October.

**Action:** If international calling or travel is rare, using TravelPass or paying per-minute as you did is likely the cheapest option. If this usage becomes more frequent, check if a monthly international add-on would be more cost-effective than stacking multiple daily TravelPasses.

### Confirm Add-On Subscriptions
A "100 GB Mobile Hotspot" add-on appeared in October, though it was offset by a credit.

**Action:** Verify if this add-on is necessary for line (463-724-9854) and confirm that the "Mobile Home Perk Credit" is permanent. If the credit expires, this add-on will cost $10/month.

### Acknowledge Current Discounts
You are already leveraging several key discounts, which you should ensure remain active:

- **Auto Pay and paper-free billing discount:** Applied to all eligible lines
- **Loyalty Discount:** $10 or $20 monthly discounts are applied to several lines
- **Valued Customer Discount:** A $30 account-wide discount is applied each month
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** Credits are active on lines (317-407-1576), (317-835-1874), and (716-346-7018)
