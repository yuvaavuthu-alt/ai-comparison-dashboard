# Verizon Mobile + Home Internet Deals for Thanksgiving/Christmas 2025

## Why bundle Verizon wireless with Fios or 5G Home Internet?

Verizon's Mobile + Home Discount lowers the cost of home internet when any post‑paid myPlan wireless plan is combined with Verizon Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home internet. The current promotion saves $15 per month on the home‑internet portion and also lets qualifying customers pick one entertainment or productivity perk worth up to $10/month at no extra cost. The discount applies automatically for 5G Home or LTE Home; Fios customers must enroll via My Verizon. The perk credit requires at least one paid perk (e.g., Disney+ bundle, Netflix+Max with ads, Apple One, YouTube Premium, unlimited cloud storage, 100 GB hotspot, 3 TravelPass days, etc.), and the credit ends if the paid perk or eligible internet plan is removed. In addition to the Mobile + Home Discount, Verizon's holiday offers include:

- **Free gifts for new Fios 1 Gig/2 Gig or 5G Home Ultimate customers:** customers who sign up by Jan. 7 2026 and keep service for at least 14 days can choose a 43 inch Samsung Q7F QLED TV, Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G or Nintendo Switch. These plans come with a 3‑ or 4‑year price guarantee.

- **Perk On Us credit:** customers with Fios 1 Gig/2 Gig, 5G Home Ultimate or LTE Home Plus can pick one $10–$15/month perk free by paying for one perk on a wireless line.

- **YouTube TV discount:** new customers switching to select Verizon Home Internet plans can save $20/month for 6 months on YouTube TV.

- **Holiday phone promotions:** Verizon's Black Friday/Christmas sale offers popular phones and companion devices "on us" with a new smartphone line on myPlan (Unlimited Welcome/Plus/Ultimate). For example, the iPhone 17, Apple Watch Series 11 and iPad are free with a new smartphone line (no trade‑in required); a $829.99 device payment is covered via bill credits over 36 months. Similar bundles are available for Samsung Galaxy S25, Google Pixel 10 and Motorola Razr devices.

- **Veteran/teacher/first‑responder discounts:** eligible customers can stack the Mobile + Home Discount with existing military, teacher or first‑responder discounts, bringing additional savings.

## MyPlan unlimited wireless choices

Verizon's myPlan system lets families mix and match unlimited tiers and add optional perks. For households needing premium data and hotspot allowances, Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate offer better network priority than the entry‑level Unlimited Welcome.

| Plan (4‑line price w/ Auto‑Pay & paperless billing) | Monthly cost per line* | Total for 4 lines* | Key features | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unlimited Welcome | $30/line | $120 | Unlimited talk, text & data on Verizon's nationwide 5G/4G network; data can be deprioritized during congestion; no hotspot data (hotspot perk can be added for $10). | Budget‑conscious families who stream occasionally and live in an area with less network congestion. |
| Unlimited Plus | $45/line | $180 | Access to 5G Ultra Wideband (faster C‑band and mmWave), unlimited premium data (no deprioritization), 30 GB high‑speed hotspot included and 4K video; qualifies for 50 % off one tablet/smartwatch/hotspot plan. | Balanced households who want strong performance and hotspot data; pairs well with Fios or 5G Home discount. |
| Unlimited Ultimate | $55/line (total $220) | $220 | Includes 5G Ultra Wideband, 60 GB hotspot, international data & calling, and deeper travel benefits; qualifies for the same device discounts as Plus. | Heavy data users, frequent travellers and families wanting maximum perks. |

*Prices exclude taxes & fees and include $10/line Auto‑Pay discount. Single‑line and two‑line plans cost more per line; myPlan allows lines to be mixed (e.g., some lines on Plus and others on Welcome).

| Fios 500 Mbps | $74.99/mo | $59.99/mo after discount | 4‑year price guarantee; does not include free gift or free perk credit but still gets $15 discount when bundled. | Families who need solid speeds but don't require gigabit; lower cost when combined with Unlimited Welcome. |
| 5G Home Ultimate | $75/mo | $60/mo after discount | Includes free Samsung TV/Tab S10 FE 5G/Nintendo Switch, 4‑yr price guarantee, equipment included and qualifies for the free perk credit. | Best non‑fiber option where Fios isn't available; high‑speed wireless (up to 1 Gbps) with simple self‑installation. |
| 5G Home Plus | $60/mo | $45/mo after discount | No free gift but qualifies for the free perk credit; speeds up to 500 Mbps. | Cheaper fixed‑wireless alternative; good for average‑size households. |
| LTE Home Plus | $80/mo | $65/mo after discount | No free gift; qualifies for the free perk credit. | Areas without Fios or 5G Home; slower speeds (~50 Mbps) but adequate for light use. |

## Tips for maximizing value

- **Enroll in Auto‑Pay and paper‑free billing** to receive the advertised wireless discounts; without Auto‑Pay, each line costs $10 more.

- **Claim the Mobile + Home discount promptly;** 5G Home/LTE Home customers receive it automatically, but Fios customers must enroll via My Verizon.

- **Activate at least one paid perk** (e.g., Disney+, Netflix + Max, Apple One) to qualify for the Perk On Us credit on your wireless bill; the credit provides a second perk free (up to $10/month).

- **Check device promos:** during the holiday season, Verizon offers major phones, watches and tablets for $0 with a new line on myPlan, often without trade‑in. Use these offers to equip family members with new devices while spreading the cost over 36 months.

- **Stack eligible discounts:** teacher, first‑responder, military/veteran and student discounts can stack with the Mobile + Home Discount, lowering the monthly bill even further.

## Conclusion

For a household with four wireless lines and home internet, Verizon's holiday promotions make bundling particularly attractive. The Unlimited Plus + Fios 1 Gig bundle offers a compelling mix of premium 5G performance, gigabit fiber reliability, included hotspot data, and streaming perks, all for roughly $255 per month before taxes. Customers in areas without Fios can choose Unlimited Plus + 5G Home Ultimate and pay about $240 per month while still receiving high‑speed wireless internet and the same free gift. Budget‑conscious families can opt for Unlimited Welcome + Fios 1 Gig to keep the bill under $200, though speeds may be deprioritized. Regardless of the combination, bundling mobile and home internet unlocks a $15/month discount, a free premium perk, and access to festive device promotions and free gifts that significantly boost the overall value.
