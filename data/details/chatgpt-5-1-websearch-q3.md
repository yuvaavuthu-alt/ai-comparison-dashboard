## ✅ Key deals to build around

### Mobile plan (4 unlimited lines)

* Verizon’s unlimited family plans show that for four lines, typical pricing is **around $55/line per month** under current “myPlan” unlimited offerings (for 4 lines) with AutoPay and paper-free billing. ([Verizon][1])
* For example, the “Unlimited Welcome” plan — the most basic unlimited offering — is quoted as ~$120/month for four lines by independent sources. ([Best Phone Plans][2])
* Important: These per‐line rates are *before* any extra discounts, perks or bundling credits.

### Home Internet + mobile bundle discounts

* Verizon offers a “Mobile + Home Discount” where if you have a postpaid Verizon mobile plan **and** a Verizon Home Internet plan (Fios, 5G Home, LTE Home), you get **$15/month off your home internet bill**. ([Verizon][3])
* Additional perk: If your home internet is a *premium* tier (e.g., Fios 1 Gig or 2 Gig, or 5G Home Ultimate), you may also get up to **$10/month credit** toward an eligible “perk” service (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, Apple One) as part of the bundle. ([Verizon][4])
* Home internet promotional pricing: For example, new Fios customers can get “as low as $20/mo” on certain plans when combined with a mobile plan and enrollment in the Mobile + Home bundle. ([Verizon][5])
* For 5G Home Internet: Plans start (in some areas) at ~$35/mo and include no annual contract, router included, etc. ([Verizon][6])

### Additional “holiday” / limited-time perks

* Fios deals: For eligible new customers, Fios 300 Mbps shows “save $15/mo for 3 years” when switching. ([Verizon][7])
* In many cases, Fios bundle pages show free equipment, router included, and “price lock” guarantee for multi-years. ([Verizon Specials][8])
* Note: Some promotions (via third parties) may include free devices (TVs, tablets) etc. These need to be evaluated for eligibility, region, and whether you must trade in etc.

## 🔍 Example calculation for your situation: 4 unlimited lines + home internet

Let’s assume you choose:

* Four lines on Verizon’s unlimited plan (at ~$55 per line)
* A home internet plan via Fios (or 5G Home)
* You enable Auto Pay + paperless to get all discounts, enroll in Mobile + Home

### Estimate baseline costs

* Wireless: 4 lines × ~$55 = **$220/month**
* Home Internet: Let’s assume a plan list price ~$49.99/mo (or higher), but with bundle discount maybe ~$35/mo (or even lower in promotional cases)

  * For example, Fios “as low as $20/mo” for new customers combined with mobile + home discount. But let’s conservatively assume ~$35/mo.
* Total = ~$220 + ~$35 = **$255/month** before taxes/fees

### Estimate bundle savings

* Home internet discount: –$15/mo via Mobile + Home = reduces to ~$20/mo for the internet line (if list was $35)
* Additional perk credit (if you pick premium internet tier) – $10/mo toward streaming service
* Therefore net internet cost maybe ~$20/mo (plus you’re getting ~$10/mo value via streaming perk)
* So effectively: wireless $220 + internet ~$20 = **$240/month** net cost, plus you receive ~$10/mo in perk value = effectively ~$230/month “out-of-pocket” value for full bundle.

### Annualized savings

* Without bundle discount: internet might have been ~$35–$50/mo → ~$420–$600/year. With discount, you save ~$15/mo → ~$180/year.
* Streaming perk credit: ~$10/month → ~$120/year (if you pick a service you use).
* Over a 3-year price lock period, these savings multiply.

### Additional potential savings

* If you switch from another provider: Fios may offer ET fee credits (up to ~$500) in some promotions. ([Verizon][9])
* Combine with other applicable discounts (teacher, military/veteran, first responder) for further reduction. ([Verizon][10])
* Choosing higher internet speed tiers (1 Gig or 2 Gig) may offer free equipment or bonuses (e.g., free TV or tablet) in holiday promos.   ([Verizon][7])

## 🎯 My recommendation for you (household of 4)

Since you have four unlimited lines and home internet is required, here’s what I’d suggest to **maximize value**:

1. **Pick the wireless unlimited plan for 4 lines** that has a 3-year price lock (Verizon’s myPlan unlimited lines) and aim for ~$55/line or better.
2. **Choose the highest available home internet tier in your area** (check availability: Fios fiber vs 5G Home). If Fios is available, go with a mid-to-high speed plan (e.g., 300 Mb or more) that qualifies for the Mobile + Home bundle.
3. **Enroll in the Mobile + Home discount** to ensure you get the $15/mo off and the up to $10/mo streaming perk.
4. **Ensure Auto Pay + paperless billing** are enabled, and your accounts are linked properly (mobile + home).
5. **Compare promotional offers** for new customers: if you're switching to Verizon, you may qualify for deeper promotional pricing (e.g., $20/mo Fios) for a fixed period (3 years).
6. **Select the streaming/entertainment perk wisely** (Netflix, Disney+, etc.) — even if you already pay for one, the $10/mo credit effectively offsets that cost.
7. **Lock in the best speed tier you realistically need**, since higher tiers may have better promos (free equipment) and may set you up for 3-5 years with no rate increase (Verizon offers price lock for certain plans).
8. **Check the fine print**: These offers may require new customers, certain auto-pay requirements, and maybe a setup/installation fee. Also verify what happens at the end of the promotional period (e.g., after 36 months).

## 📝 Things to watch / potential caveats

* The $55/line figure is *base rate* for unlimited plans with 4 lines — does *not* include taxes, fees, or any add-ons (hotspot data, premium video streaming) that you might want.
* The home internet discount is tied to maintaining both services; if you cancel mobile or home, you may lose the discount. ([Verizon][4])
* Promotional “as low as $20/mo” pricing may require new customers, specific term commitments (e.g., price lock), and may increase after promotional period ends. e.g., Fios 300 Mbps “as low as $20/mo” for limited time. ([Verizon][5])
* Availability: Fios fiber is not available everywhere; if you are in a location without Fios, you may be limited to 5G Home Internet, with different pricing and potentially slower upload speeds (wireless vs fiber).
* Internet speed vs your needs: If you have multiple people streaming in 4K, gaming, working from home, you may want the faster tier (1 Gig or 2 Gig) which may cost more but may also include bigger promos.
* Equipment, installation fees: Even with a “low monthly price,” there may be one-time fees; check what you will owe up front.
* End of promo: Many “save $15/mo for 3 years” offers apply for 36 months; afterwards, monthly rate may increase. ([Verizon][7])

## 🔮 My best guess “deal” for you today

Given your situation (4 unlimited lines + home internet) and the current offers, you could aim for something like:

* Wireless (4 lines unlimited) ~ **$220/month**
* Home internet (after $15 bundle discount) ~ **$20-$30/month** (assuming you choose a good tier and qualify)
* Perk credit ~ **$10/month** value (streaming service)
* Total effective cost ~ **$230-$240/month** for all five services (4 mobiles + home internet + streaming perk)
* Annual cost ~ ~$2,760-$2,880; annual effective value (including perk) ~ maybe ~$2,580–$2,700.

If you find an especially strong holiday promotion (e.g., new customer Fios at $20/mo for 3 years), you might reduce home internet cost further and get extras (free TV, free tablet) which improves value.
