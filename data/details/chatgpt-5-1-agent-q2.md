# ChatGPT-5.1 Agent Mode - Question 2

## Question
I'm planning to upgrade two of my Verizon lines to new 5G phones. Compare Verizon's current options for buying recent iPhone and Android flagship devices (full price, monthly installments, and promotions with trade-in), and tell me which combination gives the lowest total cost over 36 months for a family of four, assuming two existing phones are eligible for trade-in.
