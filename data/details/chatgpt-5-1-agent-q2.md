Verizon smartphone upgrade analysis (Nov 2025)

Recent flagship phones available on Verizon

Verizon’s product pages list the current iPhone and Android flagships along with pricing and promotional offers.  The iPhone 17 Pro has a full retail price of $1 099.99 and normally costs $30.55 per month for 36 months ￼.  However, Verizon’s promotion states that when you trade in an eligible phone and choose the Unlimited Ultimate plan, you receive a device‑savings credit of $30.55 per month, reducing the phone cost to $0 per month ￼ ￼.  A one‑time activation fee of $40 per device applies ￼.

Verizon still sells the iPhone 15, which has a lower retail price.  Its full price is $629.99, and the normal 36‑month payment is $17.49 per month ￼.  With a qualifying trade‑in on an unlimited plan the site lists a device‑savings credit of $17.50 per month that makes the monthly cost $0 ￼; unlike the Ultimate‑only offers, this credit is available on lower‑tier unlimited plans, so no expensive plan upgrade is required.  Each phone still incurs a $40 activation fee ￼.

For Android fans, Verizon offers the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 10 Pro.  The S25 Ultra’s retail price is $1 299.99 with a standard installment of $36.11 per month for 36 months ￼.  With an eligible trade‑in and the Unlimited Ultimate plan, Verizon provides a device‑savings credit of $31.12 per month, lowering the payment to $4.99 per month ￼ ￼; a $40 activation fee applies ￼.  The Pixel 10 Pro costs $999.99 outright and normally $27.77 per month for 36 months ￼.  Verizon’s deals page advertises “Google Pixel 10 Pro on us”—customers who trade in an eligible phone and sign up for Unlimited Ultimate get the Pixel free.  Like the other promotions, this requires turning in a phone and moving to the top‑tier plan; the activation fee remains $40 per device ￼.

Verizon unlimited plan costs

Verizon’s myPlan site shows that with Auto Pay and paper‑free billing, the Unlimited Welcome plan costs $30 per line for four lines, Unlimited Plus costs $45 per line, and Unlimited Ultimate costs $55 per line ￼.  These prices exclude taxes and fees and represent the base monthly rate for four lines.  Customers can mix and match plans per line; therefore a family upgrading two lines to Ultimate can keep the other two lines on a cheaper plan.

Cost comparison methodology

The family currently has four lines on Unlimited Welcome ($30/line).  Two lines will upgrade to new phones.  Each new phone has a $40 activation fee, and the device payments use Verizon’s 0 % APR 36‑month financing.  To evaluate trade‑in promotions fairly, the analysis assumes that:
	•	The household keeps its two non‑upgrading lines on Unlimited Welcome.
	•	Promotions requiring Unlimited Ultimate upgrade only the two new‑phone lines.  Moving those two lines from $30 to $55 per month adds $25 per line, or $50 per month ($1 800 over 36 months).
	•	“Promo device cost” represents the residual device payments after bill‑credit savings.  For phones advertised as “on us,” the device payments drop to $0.

Device‑level costs

The table below summarizes the device costs for two phones (since two lines are being upgraded).  Device costs include activation fees.  Monthly and full‑price options cost the same in total (monthly payments simply spread the retail price over 36 months at 0 % APR).  The final column shows the promo cost with the added cost of upgrading two lines to Unlimited Ultimate when required.

Device (2 units)	Full retail cost (2 phones + activation)	36‑mo installment cost (no promo)	Promo device payments (trade‑in, 36 mo)	Unlimited plan required?	Promo cost with plan upgrade (device payments + activation + higher plan)
iPhone 15	$629.99 × 2 + $40 × 2 = $1 339.98 ￼	$17.49 /mo × 36 × 2 + $80 = $1 339.28	Device credits of $17.50/mo make payments $0; only the $80 activation fee remains ￼	Trade‑in credit applies on any Unlimited plan	$4 400 total over 36 months (baseline plan cost $4 320 + $80 activation)
iPhone 17 Pro	$1 099.99 × 2 + $80 = $2 279.98 ￼	$30.55/mo × 36 × 2 + $80 = $2 279.60	After a $30.55/mo device credit the payments drop to $0 ￼ ￼; $80 activation remains	Requires Unlimited Ultimate	$6 200 total (plan upgrade adds $1 800; device/activation costs $80)
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra	$1 299.99 × 2 + $80 = $2 679.98 ￼	$36.11/mo × 36 × 2 + $80 = $2 679.92	Bill credits of $31.12/mo reduce payments to $4.99 per month ￼ ￼ (2 phones cost $359.28 over 36 months); $80 activation	Requires Unlimited Ultimate	$6 559.28 total (plan upgrade $1 800 + promo device payments $359.28 + $80 activation)
Google Pixel 10 Pro	$999.99 × 2 + $80 = $2 079.98 ￼	$27.77/mo × 36 × 2 + $80 = $2 079.44	Verizon’s deals page advertises “Google Pixel 10 Pro on us” for existing or new customers who trade in a phone and take Unlimited Ultimate, so device payments drop to $0; $80 activation remains	Requires Unlimited Ultimate	$6 200 total (plan upgrade $1 800 + $80 activation)

Family‑level cost comparison

Under the baseline, the family’s four lines remain on Unlimited Welcome at $30 per line, which costs $120 per month.  Over 36 months the baseline plan cost is $4 320.  Upgrading two lines to Unlimited Ultimate raises those lines to $55 each; the other two lines stay at $30 each.  This mixed plan costs $170 per month and $6 120 over 36 months—an extra $1 800 compared with staying on Unlimited Welcome.

The chart below combines the plan costs with device costs to show the total amount spent over 36 months for two upgraded phones and four service lines.

Device combination (2 phones)	Purchase method	Plan requirement	Total 36‑mo cost (plan + devices)	Notes
iPhone 15	Full price or monthly installments	Unlimited Welcome	≈$5 660	Buy two phones outright (or on installments) and keep all four lines on the Welcome plan; total includes $4 320 plan cost + $1 340 devices & activation.
iPhone 15	Trade‑in promo	Unlimited Welcome or Plus	≈$4 400	Trade in two old phones and get $17.50/mo bill credit; device cost is only the $80 activation for two phones ￼, and there’s no requirement to move to Ultimate.  This is the lowest total cost because it avoids the $1 800 plan upgrade.
iPhone 17 Pro	Full price or monthly installments	Unlimited Welcome	≈$6 600	Buying two phones at full price ($2 280 with activation) plus baseline plan.
iPhone 17 Pro	Trade‑in promo	Unlimited Ultimate	≈$6 200	Phones are free with trade‑in ￼ ￼, but the two upgraded lines must move to Unlimited Ultimate, adding $1 800 in plan costs.
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra	Full price or monthly installments	Unlimited Welcome	≈$7 000	Two devices cost $2 680 plus the baseline plan.
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra	Trade‑in promo	Unlimited Ultimate	≈$6 559	Promotion lowers device payments to $4.99/mo ￼ ￼, but plan upgrade cost makes this option more expensive than iPhone 17 Pro or Pixel.
Google Pixel 10 Pro	Full price or monthly installments	Unlimited Welcome	≈$6 400	Two devices cost $2 080 plus the baseline plan.
Google Pixel 10 Pro	Trade‑in promo	Unlimited Ultimate	≈$6 200	Verizon’s deal page promises the Pixel 10 Pro “on us” with trade‑in on Unlimited Ultimate; device cost is $80 activation.  Plan upgrade raises the total to the same level as the iPhone 17 Pro promo.

Recommendations
	1.	Best overall value: Trading in two existing phones for iPhone 15 devices and keeping the family on the Unlimited Welcome (or Plus) plan yields the lowest total cost (~$4 400).  The iPhone 15 still offers modern features and 5G support, and Verizon’s trade‑in promotion wipes out the entire monthly device cost (only the $40 activation fee per device remains) ￼.
	2.	Best Android option: If the family prefers Android flagships, the Google Pixel 10 Pro promotion comes closest to the iPhone 17 Pro deal.  Both phones become free after trade‑in, but they require upgrading the two lines to Unlimited Ultimate, adding $1 800 over 36 months.  The total cost is ~$6 200, which is cheaper than paying full price for Android phones or using the Samsung trade‑in offer.
	3.	iPhone 17 Pro trade‑in vs. full price: The iPhone 17 Pro trade‑in promotion saves roughly $400 versus buying the phones outright, even after accounting for the required plan upgrade.  However, families should consider whether they need the Ultimate plan’s high‑end benefits (extra hotspot data and international roaming) ￼; if not, staying on a cheaper plan and buying a less expensive phone may be more cost‑effective.
	4.	Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: This phone receives a sizable discount ($31.12/mo off) with trade‑in ￼ ￼, but the remaining $4.99/mo payment plus the Ultimate plan requirement make it the most expensive of the promotional options (~$6 559 total).
