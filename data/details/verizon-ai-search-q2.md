# Verizon AI Search - Question 2

## Question
I'm planning to upgrade two of my Verizon lines to new 5G phones. Compare Verizon's current options for buying recent iPhone and Android flagship devices (full price, monthly installments, and promotions with trade-in), and tell me which combination gives the lowest total cost over 36 months for a family of four, assuming two existing phones are eligible for trade-in.

You can acquire new 5G phones, such as the iPhone Air, Samsung Galaxy S25+, and Google Pixel 10 Pro, through several options.

Verizon offers:

Full Price: You can purchase devices outright.
Monthly Installments: Devices can be financed over 36 months.
Promotions: Verizon's Guaranteed Trade-in Promo requires a smartphone trade-in from Apple, Google, or Samsung and a new line for 36 months. The trade-in or promotional credit is applied over these 36 months. Both new and existing customers are eligible for current in-market smartphone offers with a trade-in when upgrading an existing device or adding a line to an Unlimited Welcome or Unlimited Plus plan.
