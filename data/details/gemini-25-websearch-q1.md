### Detailed Breakdown of New Perks

Here is a side-by-side comparison to make the differences clear:

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data** | Unlimited 5G | **Unlimited Premium 5G & 5G Ultra Wideband** |
| **Data Speeds** | Can be slowed down when the network is busy (deprioritized). 5G UW speeds are limited. | **No slowdowns** due to congestion. **Full, un-capped** 5G Ultra Wideband speeds. |
| **Mobile Hotspot** | **Not included.** (Must be added as a $10/mo perk) | **200 GB** of high-speed hotspot data included. (Speeds reduced to 6 Mbps after 200 GB) |
| **International Travel** | Talk, text, & data in Mexico & Canada only. Travel to other countries requires a daily **TravelPass ($12/day)**. | **Unlimited talk, text, & data in 210+ countries included.** (First 15 GB is high-speed, then 1.5 Mbps speeds) |
| **International Calling** | Talk to Mexico & Canada only. | **Global Choice included:** Up to 300 minutes per month to call **one country** of your choice from a list of 140. |
| **Video Streaming** | 480p (DVD-Quality) | **1080p** on 5G/4G LTE, and **4K Ultra HD** on 5G Ultra Wideband. |
| **Phone Upgrades** | Eligible for "Welcome Phone Upgrade" (basic deals). | Eligible for **"Ultimate Phone Upgrade,"** giving you access to Verizon's **best trade-in offers**. |
| **Connected Devices** | Standard pricing. | **Up to 50% off** 2 data plans for a watch, tablet, or hotspot. |

Both plans include the 3-year price guarantee and allow you to add the same $10/month "myPlan" perks (like the Disney Bundle, Netflix, etc.), so the primary differences are the core network and travel features listed above.

This upgrade is generally most beneficial for people who travel internationally, use their phone as a hotspot frequently, or want the absolute fastest, most reliable data speeds without any chance of slowdowns.
