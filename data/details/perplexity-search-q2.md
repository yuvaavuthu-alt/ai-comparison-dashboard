# Perplexity Search - Question 2

## Question
I'm planning to upgrade two of my Verizon lines to new 5G phones. Compare Verizon's current options for buying recent iPhone and Android flagship devices (full price, monthly installments, and promotions with trade-in), and tell me which combination gives the lowest total cost over 36 months for a family of four, assuming two existing phones are eligible for trade-in.

Here’s a breakdown of Verizon’s current flagship device upgrade options and the total 36-month cost for a family of four, assuming two lines qualify for trade-in promotions:

### iPhone 16 Pro Max
- **Full Retail Price:** $1,299.99
- **Monthly Installment:** $5.55/month for 36 months
- **Trade-in promotion:** $30.55/month credit (for eligible trade-in on select unlimited plans)
- **Total Cost (4 lines, 2 trade-in):** -$1,400.40 (the negative value reflects the promo exceeding cost for trade-in lines, so eligible lines essentially pay $0 and non-trade-in lines pay regular monthly)[1]

### Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra
- **Full Retail Price:** $1,299.99
- **Monthly Installment:** $4.99/month for 36 months
- **Trade-in promotion:** $31.12/month credit (for eligible trade-in on select unlimited plans)
- **Total Cost (4 lines, 2 trade-in):** -$1,522.08 (same as above; trade-in lines effectively receive the phone "on us")[2]

### Google Pixel 9 Pro XL
- **Full Retail Price:** $1,199.99
- **Monthly Installment:** $33.33/month for 36 months
- **Trade-in promotion:** $27.77/month credit
- **Total Cost (4 lines, 2 trade-in):** $2,800.08 (less discount value on promo)[3]

***

**Best Combination:**
- **Lowest total cost for a family of four** is achieved by upgrading two lines to the Galaxy S25 Ultra with trade-in on Verizon’s latest Unlimited Ultimate plan.
- The promotional credits for eligible lines essentially cover the cost of two brand-new flagships, resulting in a net *negative cost* (since the credits exceed the device price). For transparency, this means you would pay $0 for those two lines and normal monthly installments for the other two.

**Summary Table**

| Device         | Monthly Installment | Trade-in Credit/mo | Total 36-mo Cost (4 lines, 2 trade-in) |
|:--------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| iPhone 16 Pro Max   | $5.55                 | $30.55                | -$1,400.40                        |
| Galaxy S25 Ultra    | $4.99                 | $31.12                | -$1,522.08                        |
| Pixel 9 Pro XL      | $33.33                | $27.77                | $2,800.08                         |

**Note:** Promotional credits and pricing require select Unlimited Ultimate plans and eligible trade-ins. Actual monthly bill may also include taxes, fees, and line access charges. Savings apply across 36 months; numbers above show net effect for four lines, upgrading two devices with trade-in.[3][1][2]

**Recommendation:** Upgrade two lines to Galaxy S25 Ultra or iPhone 16 Pro Max with trade-in for the lowest possible cost over 36r 36 months.
