You can get deals that bundle wireless plans with Verizon Fios Home Internet or Verizon 5G Home Internet. Verizon offers a Mobile + Home Discount that allows you to save $15/month when you bundle mobile and home internet services. This discount remains active as long as you maintain qualifying plans and both accounts are in good standing.

Additionally, new home internet customers who activate and keep eligible Fios 2 Gig, Fios 1 Gig, 5G Home Ultimate, or LTE Home Plus service can receive promotional offers such as a Samsung 43 Class Q7F QLED TV or a Nintendo Switch system. Fios plans can start as low as $20/month with autopay, the Mobile + Home Discount, and a bonus discount for 3 years.

You can also get a credit of up to $10/month on your Verizon mobile bill if you have one paid perk on an eligible Verizon mobile phone line or an eligible home internet plan. These perks include options like Netflix & hbo max (With Ads), Apple One, or 3 travelpass Days.
