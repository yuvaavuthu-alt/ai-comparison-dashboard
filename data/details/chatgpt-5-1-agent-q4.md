# Verizon Bill Analysis and Cost‑Saving Recommendations (May – Oct 2025)

## Overview

I reviewed six monthly Verizon Wireless bills dated 28 May 2025 through 28 Oct 2025 and compiled the charges for each individual line. The bills cover lines assigned to Divya Lingireddy and family members (Chandresh Reddy Sura, Abhishek, Swathi Vangala, Raghav Singamshetty, Sai Srilekha Aluru and others). Each bill lists the total charge per line including taxes and fees. One‑time charges such as international calls, TravelPasses and activation fees are called out separately in the bills.

## Monthly charges per line

The table below summarises the total charge for each line (including taxes & fees) for every billing cycle. Amounts are in USD. A "Remaining" column captures charges from additional lines not individually detailed in the summary (for example, new lines or device‑only charges). Blank entries represent months where a line was not active.

| Month | Abhishek 317‑626‑9963 | Chandresh 317‑414‑3245 | Divya 317‑407‑1576 | Divya 317‑671‑3776 | Divya 317 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| May 2025 | 67.05 | 58.66 | 31.50 | 55.88 | 31.50 |
| Jun 2025 | 56.92 | 48.54 | 21.37 | 45.76 | 31.52 |
| Jul 2025 | 56.90 | 48.53 | 21.35 | 45.75 | 31.51 |
| Aug 2025 | 56.90 | 48.53 | 21.35 | 45.75 | 31.51 |
| Sep 2025 | 57.28 | 48.90 | 21.73 | 46.12 | 31.87 |
| Oct 2025 | 57.30 | 48.92 | 4.42 | 46.14 | 18.48 |

## Observations

- Abhishek's line is consistently around $57 per month while Chandresh and Swathi each pay roughly $49 per month.
- Divya's 317‑407‑1576 line dropped dramatically in the October bill due to a partial credit and loyalty discount; the bill notes a loyalty discount and partial credit for 22 days.
- The Remaining column grows from $42.91 in May to $155.02 in September, reflecting new lines or device payment plans not individually itemised. These lines could be reviewed for necessity.

## One‑time charges, late fees and add‑ons

The bills include occasional one‑time charges and credits. Below is a month‑by‑month list of notable items (excluding routine taxes and surcharges).

| Bill month | One‑time charge/credit | Description and which line it affected |
|---|---|---|
| Jul 2025 | $2.49 International minutes | The July bill lists a one‑time charge of $2.49 for "International minutes – Mobile" on line 317‑717‑0836. This indicates the line made a call to an international destination during that billing cycle. |
| | Plan‑change credit and charge | Raghav's line (317‑938‑0409) switched from Unlimited Plus to Unlimited Welcome mid‑cycle. The bill shows a $10 credit for the removed Unlimited Plus plan and partial charges/credits for both plans. |
| | TravelPass – India | A one‑day TravelPass was charged on 21 Jul for Archita (line 317‑955‑9654) at $12.00. TravelPass allows unlimited talk, text and data abroad for a daily fee. |
| Aug 2025 | $2.49 International minutes | The August bill again shows $2.49 for "International minutes – Mobile". Using international calling features or Wi‑Fi apps could avoid this per‑minute charge. |
| Sep 2025 | $40.00 activation fee | A new line activated in the September bill generated a $40 activation fee. Activation fees are one‑time charges and cannot be waived after activation. |
| Oct 2025 | $3.58 for two international minutes & $0.30 for six international messages | The October bill includes $3.58 for two international calling minutes and $0.30 for six international text messages on Divya's line 317‑835‑1874. |
| | Loyalty discounts & Bring Your Own Device credits | Several lines received loyalty credits (e.g., –$7.33 on Divya's line and –$10 on Sai Srilekha Aluru's line) and Bring Your Own Device credits (–$5) in October. These are temporary discounts and should continue until their expiry dates. |
| | Late fees None charged (but risk noted) | All bills are paid via Auto Pay before the due date. Each bill warns that unpaid balances are subject to a late fee of 5 % of the unpaid amount or $7. No actual late fee appears during the period. However, the July and August bills note an overdue balance, meaning payment was received after the due date. |

## Recommendations to reduce future bills

### 1. Move lines that don't need premium 5G from Unlimited Plus to Unlimited Welcome.

According to Tom's Guide, Unlimited Plus costs $80 per month (price includes a $10 Auto Pay discount) and provides fast Ultra Wideband 5G and 30 GB of hotspot data. Unlimited Welcome is $65 per month with slower 5G and no hotspot but offers the same perks at lower cost. The article notes that switching from Plus to Welcome saves $180 per year for a single line. In your account, at least Chandresh, Swathi and Abhishek appear to be on Unlimited Plus (charge ≈$49 per month). If those users don't require premium speeds or hotspot data, switching them to Unlimited Welcome could save ≈$15 per line per month (≈$540 per year for three lines). Consider mixing and matching: family members who travel frequently or need hotspot can stay on Plus while others downgrade.

### 2. Ensure every line is enrolled in Auto Pay and paper‑free billing.

Verizon gives a $10/month discount on Unlimited plans when customers enroll in Auto Pay and paper‑free billing. Most lines on the October bill show this discount, but one line on a 5G Start plan only receives a $5 Auto Pay discount. Verify that all eligible lines are set up for Auto Pay to capture the maximum discount.

### 3. Review "Remaining" lines and device payment plans.

The "Remaining" column reached $155.02 in September, indicating multiple lines or device payment agreements not itemised individually. Consider whether all of these lines are needed or if any devices can be paid off and removed. Paying off device installments early eliminates monthly device charges, though be aware of promotional credits that could be forfeited.

### 4. Limit international usage or use cost‑effective alternatives.

Small but recurring charges appear for international calls (e.g., $3.58 for two minutes and $2.49 for international minutes). To avoid these charges, use Wi‑Fi calling apps (WhatsApp, FaceTime) or subscribe to an international calling add‑on if international calls are frequent. TravelPass was used once for $12; ensure it is only activated when traveling and deactivated upon returning.

### 5. Avoid unnecessary add‑ons.

Verizon offers numerous $10/month add‑on bundles (Disney/Hulu/ESPN, Apple Music family, Netflix + Max, etc.). The bills did not show streaming add‑ons, but monitor any new perks that may be added. Because add‑ons are optional and charged monthly, it is wise to add them only when needed and remove them when unused to prevent the bill from "supersizing".

### 6. Future cost comparisons – consider prepaid or alternative plans if data needs are moderate.

Verizon's prepaid 15 GB plan costs $35/month after a $10 Auto Pay discount, with mobile hotspot and nationwide 5G coverage. If some family members use less data and do not require unlimited service, switching those lines to prepaid could reduce costs further. However, prepaid plans lack multi‑line discounts and some device deals, so run a cost comparison before switching.

### 7. Monitor loyalty credits and promo expirations.

Several lines receive loyalty discounts (e.g., –$10 for 12 months) and Bring‑Your‑Own‑Device credits that gradually reduce device balances. Track the expiration dates noted in the bills (some expire in Jun 2026 or Oct 2026) to avoid sudden increases. When a loyalty credit expires, call Verizon to see if a new promotional discount is available.

## Conclusion

By reviewing the six Verizon bills, we identified that the majority of monthly charges come from plan fees and device installments. A few one‑time expenses—international calls, a TravelPass day and an activation fee—contribute modestly to overall costs. The largest opportunity for savings comes from switching lines that don't need premium 5G service from Unlimited Plus to Unlimited Welcome and by ensuring all lines are enrolled in Auto Pay to capture the full discount. Regularly checking for unnecessary add‑ons, paying off devices when practical and using Wi‑Fi for international communication will further reduce the family's Verizon expenses.

In summary, the analysis compiles per-line charges across six months and highlights one-time expenses such as international calls, a TravelPass and an activation fee, while also noting loyalty discounts and partial credits. The report shows that certain lines—particularly those on Unlimited Plus—consistently incur higher costs. Recommendations include downgrading eligible lines to Unlimited Welcome to save around $15 per line per month, ensuring all lines are enrolled in Auto Pay for the full discount, and closely monitoring loyalty credits and add-on subscriptions to prevent unexpected charges.
