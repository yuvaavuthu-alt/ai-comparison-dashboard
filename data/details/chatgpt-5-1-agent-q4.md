# ChatGPT-5.1 Agent Mode - Question 4

## Question
I've uploaded my last six Verizon wireless bills as PDF files. Please read them and: (1) create a month-by-month table of total charges per line, including taxes and fees, (2) list any one-time charges, late fees, or add-on subscriptions, and (3) recommend specific changes (plan changes, removing add-ons, discounts like Auto Pay/Paperless) that would lower my overall Verizon bill.
