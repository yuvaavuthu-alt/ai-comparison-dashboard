Thanks! I’ll create a month-by-month table of total charges per line (including taxes and fees), identify any one-time or add-on charges, and recommend changes (like plan adjustments or discount opportunities) that could help lower your Verizon bill.

I’ll let you know as soon as the full summary and recommendations are ready. You can continue chatting with me while I work on it.

# Monthly Charges per Line (April–October 2025)

The table below summarizes the total monthly charges per phone line, including taxes and fees, as billed in each cycle (bill dates April 29 through October 28, 2025). An "N/A" indicates the line was not active during that billing period. The account's total charge each month is shown in the last row.

**Notes:** 1) Line 317-407-1576 received significant loyalty credits by Oct. 2025, reducing its net October charge to only ~$4. 2) Swathi's July charges were slightly higher due to a mid-cycle plan change. 3) Line 317-835-1874 changed from an Unlimited Plus plan to a cheaper Welcome plan in Oct., reflected by the drop in cost. 4) Sai's line (317-938-0409) was on an Unlimited Plus plan during summer (≈$55) and was downgraded to Unlimited Welcome in Oct., reducing the charge to $38. 5) New line 716-346-7018 was activated in Sept. 2025 with an Unlimited Welcome plan. The first bill included a $40 activation fee and one month's charges, totaling $56.76. 6) Line 7018 was disconnected early in the Oct. cycle, so all Oct. charges were credited back (net $0).

## One-Time Charges, Fees, and Subscription Changes

- **Activation Fees & Credits:** A one-time $40 activation fee was charged for new line activations (e.g. line 716-346-7018 in Sept). In October, Verizon issued a –$40 credit reversing an activation fee on a returned line/device.

- **Device Purchase/Return:** New device payments appear under each line (e.g. monthly $27.77 for an iPhone 14 Pro). In Oct., a device return credit of –$16.66 was applied when an old device plan was canceled early.

- **Late Payment Fee:** The July and August bills show overdue balances with small fees. In July, an unpaid balance was carried over and only $6.30 remained after an $80.63 courtesy credit. Another $6.93 fee appears in August. These likely reflect late fees/interest on overdue amounts (5% of the balance, or $7 minimum) and were added to the account-wide charges. Paying on time would avoid these fees.

- **Plan Changes:** Several lines changed plans mid-cycle. For example, in July the bill notes "Plan changed" for Swathi's line, reflecting a switch (her line's cost went from $45.75 to $49.17 due to partial proration). In Sept., a "New plan added" appears for the activation of line 7018, and Ashwin's new line had a partial-month plan charge (~$10) for Sept (noted as "Plan $10.00" in the bill). In October, multiple lines (e.g. 317-835-1874 and 317-938-0409) were downgraded from Unlimited Plus to Unlimited Welcome, resulting in prorated credits for the unused portion of the higher-tier plan. Each affected line shows a one-time partial plan credit (e.g. –$10 for Oct 7–28) alongside the new lower plan charge.

- **International Usage:** The account incurred small one-time charges for international calls/texts. For example, the October bill shows $3.58 for 2 international minutes and $0.30 for 6 international texts on one line. These pay-per-use charges increased that month's bill slightly. No dedicated international plan was active.

- **Add-On Subscriptions:** The only notable add-on is a "100 GB Mobile Hotspot" feature added to one line in Oct., with a $10 cost that was fully offset by a –$10 Mobile + Home discount (because the account has a Verizon home internet bundle). This perk resulted in no net charge. We did not find other paid add-on subscriptions like device insurance or premium content – their absence suggests the account wasn't paying extra for such services.

## Recommendations to Reduce the Monthly Bill

### 1. Downgrade Expensive Plans

Several lines are on the 5G Unlimited Plus plan at $55 base price. If these lines do not heavily use premium features (like 5G Ultra Wideband, high-speed hotspot, or HD streaming), switching them to the 5G Start/Welcome plan can save about $15 per line each month. For example, Sai's line was moved from Unlimited Plus to Unlimited Welcome in October, cutting its cost from ~$55 to ~$38. Chandresh's and Swathi's lines (and any others on Unlimited Plus) could similarly be switched to the Welcome plan to immediately reduce charges while still providing unlimited data. This downgrade would yield significant savings across multiple lines without much impact on typical usage.

### 2. Remove or Combine Underutilized Lines

Evaluate whether all active lines are truly needed. One line under Divya's name (317-407-1576) had very low usage costs by October (only $4 after credits), suggesting it might be a secondary or lightly-used line. If it's not necessary, consider disconnecting that line once any device payment or contract on it is fulfilled. The account already eliminated one unused line (716-346-7018) in October; continuing to prune redundant lines will stop those monthly charges entirely. If certain lines are used only occasionally (e.g. a spare phone or a tablet device), you might also explore seasonal suspensions or switching to a metered/prepaid plan for those devices to save money. Every eliminated line could save ~$30–$50 per month (depending on its plan).

### 3. Optimize or Remove Add-Ons

The account currently isn't paying extra for many add-ons, which is good. Ensure it stays that way. For instance, the 100GB hotspot add-on is free due to the Mobile+Home promo – but if you ever drop Verizon home internet (which provides the $10 credit), that hotspot feature would start costing $10/month. In that case, be ready to remove the hotspot add-on (or any similar perk) if it's not essential. Additionally, monitor any pay-per-use charges like international calls/texts – if international usage will recur, consider adding an international plan or using Wi-Fi calling/apps to avoid per-minute fees. Keeping add-ons limited to what you actually use will prevent small fees from adding up.

### 4. Leverage Discounts and Promotions

The account already benefits from several discounts – make sure none are missed. All lines are enrolled in Auto Pay and paper-free billing, which yields $10 off per line every month. Continue using a bank account or debit card for Auto Pay to maximize this discount (credit cards may get a lower discount). The account also received loyalty credits (e.g. "$10 off for 12 months" on multiple lines and even a $20 loyalty credit on a new line). When those 12-month loyalty discounts approach expiration, call Verizon's retention department to request an extension or new loyalty credits – often they will extend promotions to keep long-term customers. Furthermore, verify that the "Valued Customer $30 off 4 lines" discount (which provided $30 off the account each month) is still in effect; if not, inquire if a similar loyalty or bundle discount can be applied again. Verizon frequently has promotions for adding lines or for bundling mobile with home internet – since you have both, ensure you're getting all eligible bundle credits (the Mobile + Home $10 credit is one, which you are receiving). Finally, periodically review Verizon's latest plans: if they introduce a new plan or "mix-and-match" option that is cheaper for certain lines (for example, a basic plan for a child's phone or an older relative), you can move that line to the new plan without affecting others. Taking advantage of these promotions and plan flexibility can further trim the overall bill.

### 5. Maintain Timely Payments

Avoiding late payments will save the 5% late fee (around $6–$7 in your case) that was applied in mid-2025. Enabling Auto Pay (which you have done) typically prevents missing a due date. Just ensure the funding source remains valid to prevent any late charges that needlessly increase the bill.

---

By implementing these changes – downgrading plans where appropriate, cutting out unused lines and services, and leveraging all available discounts – you can significantly reduce your monthly Verizon bill while still meeting your usage needs. For example, switching just two Unlimited Plus lines to Welcome will save about $30/month (before taxes), and removing an unnecessary $35–$45 line saves that full amount. Combined with continued loyalty credits and avoiding fees, these steps should bring your wireless costs down to a much more manageable level. Each billing cycle, review the "Bill summary by line" and look for any new extras or high-cost lines to continually optimize your account's setup. This proactive approach will ensure you're only paying for what you truly need.
