## 1. Core things Unlimited Ultimate includes

From Verizon’s current myPlan page and FAQs, Unlimited Ultimate gives you: citeturn3search1turn3search6  

- **Unlimited talk, text & data** on 5G and 4G LTE  
- **5G Ultra Wideband** access (their fastest 5G) with **enhanced video calling & streaming**  
- **Unlimited mobile hotspot data** (with a big high-speed bucket, details below) citeturn2search0turn3search6  
- **Unlimited international talk, text & data** in **210+ countries/destinations** citeturn3search1turn2search0turn2search3  
- **International calling from the U.S. with Global Choice** (minutes to one selected country) citeturn3search1turn3search6  
- **Ultimate Phone Upgrade** – access to Verizon’s best phone deals now and again when you upgrade, as long as you stay on Ultimate citeturn3search0turn3search13  
- **Up to 50% off 2 connected-device lines** (watches, tablets, hotspots, etc.) citeturn3search1turn3search6turn3search11  
- **3-year price-lock guarantee** on your plan’s base monthly rate citeturn3search1turn3search16  
- Eligibility to add **$10/mo “plan perks”** like Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+, Netflix & Max, Apple One, YouTube Premium, TravelPass days, extra hotspot, cloud storage, etc. citeturn4search5turn4search3turn4search9turn4search11turn4search12turn4search18  

Those are the built-in benefits; the “perks” are optional add-ons you can mix and match.

## 2. Network performance upgrades vs Unlimited Welcome

On **Unlimited Welcome**, you already have unlimited 5G, but: during congestion your data can be slowed versus higher-tier plans, and 5G Ultra Wideband + hotspot are not included by default. citeturn3search2turn2search18  

On **Unlimited Ultimate**, you get:

- **5G Ultra Wideband (UW) access**  
  - Significantly faster than Verizon’s regular low-band 5G (their own testing shows ~3× faster on UW). citeturn0search2turn3search6  
  - Supports **4K / Ultra HD streaming** on UW and up to **1080p** on regular 5G/LTE. citeturn0search2turn3search6  

- **Unlimited premium data**  
  - Verizon treats Unlimited Ultimate (and Plus) as **“unlimited premium data”** – your on-device data isn’t put in a small priority bucket; you shouldn’t get deprioritized just for using “too much,” unlike many cheaper plans. citeturn2search8turn2search6turn2search21  

In plain terms: you move from “basic 5G that can slow first when things are busy” to **top priority on Verizon’s fastest 5G**, which you’ll especially feel in crowded areas and for heavy streaming or gaming.

---

## 3. Hotspot: from basically none to “laptop-all-month” level

This is probably the single biggest practical upgrade.

- **Unlimited Ultimate hotspot today**  
  - **200 GB per month of high-speed 5G/4G hotspot data**, then  
  - **Unlimited hotspot at up to 6 Mbps** after that for the rest of the billing cycle. citeturn3search6turn2search0turn2search23turn3search16turn2search20  

That’s enough for serious laptop use, streaming, and working on the go.

- **Unlimited Welcome hotspot**  
  - No hotspot included by default; you buy it as a separate **100 GB hotspot perk**, and then speeds drop to 3 Mbps/600 Kbps afterwards. citeturn2search18turn0search6  

So switching to Ultimate gives you **a bigger built-in hotspot allowance plus unlimited fallback speed**, without having to spend one of your $10 perks on hotspot.

---

## 4. International roaming & calling perks

Unlimited Ultimate turns your line into a pretty solid travel SIM:

- **Unlimited talk & text** in **210+ countries/destinations** when you travel. citeturn3search1turn2search0turn2search3  
- **15 GB of high-speed international data per month**, then **unlimited data at ~1.5 Mbps** after that (enough for maps, messaging, email, light browsing). citeturn3search6turn2search0turn2search20turn2search24  
- **Global Choice international calling** from the U.S.: pick one of ~140 countries and get up to **300 minutes** to that country each month. citeturn0search2turn3search1turn2search3  

With **Unlimited Welcome**, you get Canada/Mexico roaming, but not this built-in worldwide package – you’d normally pay per day with TravelPass instead. citeturn2search18turn0search3turn0search14  

If you travel abroad even a couple of times a year, this is one of the biggest value adds of Ultimate.

## 5. Device & account-level perks

### a) Ultimate Phone Upgrade

Unlimited Ultimate comes with **Ultimate Phone Upgrade**, which basically does two things: citeturn3search0turn3search13turn3search14turn3search9  

- **Access to Verizon’s “best current phone offers” now and when you upgrade** (trade-in promos, “on us” deals, etc.), as long as your line stays on Unlimited Ultimate.  
- After **36 months** on Ultimate (or when your device is paid off), you’re eligible again for those top-tier promos on that line.  

So compared with Welcome’s **Welcome Phone Upgrade**, Ultimate gives you **the highest tier of upgrade guarantees and promo eligibility**.

### b) Discounts on watches / tablets / hotspots

Unlimited Ultimate also includes: citeturn3search1turn3search6turn3search11  

- **Up to 50% off 2 data-only lines** (for devices like smartwatches, tablets, hotspots, Hum, etc.).  

On Welcome, there’s no “up to 50% off two devices” benefit spelled out at this level.

### c) 3-year price lock

All myPlan unlimited tiers (Welcome, Plus, Ultimate) now have a **3-year price-lock guarantee** on the base voice/text/data charge: citeturn3search16turn3search1turn3search2turn3search12  

- Your base plan price is locked for 3 years  
- If you change plans/add lines, a new 3-year clock starts  

It’s not unique to Ultimate, but worth knowing you keep this protection when you switch.

### d) Mobile + Home discount

Having Unlimited Ultimate can also qualify you for **discounts on Verizon home internet** (5G Home/LTE Home/Fios) via the **Mobile + Home Discount**. citeturn3search1turn0search10turn2search1

## 6. Optional $10/mo “plan perks” you *can* add

These are **not** exclusive to Ultimate (Welcome and Plus can also add many of them), but **Ultimate is fully eligible**, and you may have more perks free for a few months if you catch a promo.

From Verizon’s perks pages and FAQs, typical **$10/mo add-on perks** include: citeturn4search5turn4search3turn4search8turn4search9turn4search11turn4search12turn4search18  

**Streaming & entertainment:**

- **Disney+ / Hulu / ESPN+ (with ads)** bundle perk  
- **Netflix & Max (with ads)** bundle  
- **Apple One** (Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud storage)  
- **YouTube Premium**

**Travel & connectivity:**

- **TravelPass days** perk (e.g., 3 TravelPass days for international travel)  
- **Extra hotspot data** perk (separate 100 GB hotspot perk still exists for some plans) citeturn0search6turn4search5  

**Cloud & other:**

- **Cloud storage / backup** perks (often marketed as “unlimited” or high-capacity storage)  
- Some device-protection or AI/cloud-productivity perks (like Google One AI Premium) depending on current lineup. citeturn4search10turn4search12turn0search11  

Important notes:

- Each perk is **per line** and usually **$10/mo**.  
- The exact list of perks **changes over time** (some like Walmart+ and +play credit have been removed for new sign-ups). citeturn0search11turn4search2turn4search15  
- You add / remove perks anytime in the **My Verizon app** under “Products & plan perks.” citeturn4search20turn4search5  

So with Ultimate, you can stack **strong core benefits** (premium data, hotspot, roaming) and then **layer on perks** like Disney or Netflix/Max if you want.

## 7. Promotions tied specifically to Unlimited Ultimate (not guaranteed, but common)

Verizon frequently runs its **best device promos only on Ultimate** – things like: citeturn3search8turn3news19turn3news20turn3news21turn3news22  

- “Free” or heavily discounted **flagship phones** (iPhone 17 Pro / Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Pixel 10 Pro, etc.) with a new line and/or trade-in on Unlimited Ultimate  
- Bundles like **free iPad + Apple Watch / Samsung tablet + watch** that require extra lines, but only appear with an Ultimate line  
- Limited-time extras like a few months of **Apple One** or other subscriptions baked into a phone promo  

These are **promos**, not permanent plan features, but if you’re thinking of switching to Ultimate, it’s worth checking **current deals** in the My Verizon app or on the “Deals” page when you change your plan.

## 8. Quick summary: what you gain moving from Welcome → Ultimate

Here’s the high-level “what actually changes for you” view:

**You keep:**

- Unlimited talk, text & data  
- 5G & 4G LTE access  
- 3-year price lock  
- Access to $10/mo perks

**You gain:**
