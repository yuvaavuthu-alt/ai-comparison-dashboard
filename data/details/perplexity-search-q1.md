Switching from Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome to the Unlimited Ultimate plan gives you access to Verizon’s top-tier perks and features. The Unlimited Ultimate plan is designed for heavy data users, frequent travelers, and those who want the fastest speeds and most benefits from their mobile service.

### Key Perks of Unlimited Ultimate

- 200GB of high-speed mobile hotspot data per month, followed by unlimited hotspot at 6 Mbps speeds. This is a substantial increase over other plans.[1][2]
- Unlimited premium data on Verizon’s fastest 5G Ultra Wideband network for maximum speed and no data slowdowns during congestion.[3][1]
- International travel benefits: 15GB of high-speed data per month while traveling in 210+ countries, followed by unlimited international data at 1.5 Mbps after your high-speed limit is reached. This is a notable bump from the usual international data limits.[4][2][1]
- Unlimited talk, text, and data while in Mexico and Canada, plus 2GB of high-speed data per day in those countries.[2]
- 300 calling minutes per month (Global Choice) to a country of your choice from the US, plus discounted rates after that.[4][2]
- Enhanced video streaming with 4K UHD quality when on qualifying networks.[2]
- A 3-year price lock guarantee — your plan price won’t increase for three years (excluding taxes, fees, and surcharges).[5][1]
- Option to add an extra 100GB of high-speed hotspot data for $10 monthly via Verizon’s myPlan perk system (totaling 300GB of high-speed hotspot before throttling).[1]
- Priority network access over lower-tier plans during congestion, providing a more consistent experience.[6][7]
- 50% off on plans for connected devices (like tablets or smartwatches).[8]
