I've uploaded my last six Verizon wireless bills as PDF files. Please read them and: (1) create a month-by-month table of total charges per line, including taxes and fees, (2) list any one-time charges, late fees, or add-on subscriptions, and (3) recommend specific changes (plan changes, removing add-ons, discounts like Auto Pay/Paperless) that would lower my overall Verizon bill.

**2. One-Time Charges, Late Fees, or Add-On Subscriptions**

- Activation fees (for new device/line): $40 (Aug/Sep)
- International minutes: $2.49 (Jul/Aug)
- TravelPass-India-1 day: $12.00 (Jun/Jul)
- Miscellaneous: One-time credits/charges applied for account-wide adjustments or plan changes, often as “One-time credits” reflecting overpayment, late payment, or plan realignment (visible in nearly every bill).
- Unpaid balance carryovers: Small carryovers or credits are frequently listed, not necessarily late fees but sometimes partial-period adjustments.
- No recurring entertainment add-ons (like Disney Bundle or Apple Music) were itemized as active in the detailed line-items in the provided months.[2][3][4][1]

**3. Recommendations to Lower Your Overall Verizon Bill**

- **Auto Pay + Paperless Billing:** All recent bills apply a $10/month discount per eligible line, and you are already benefiting from this. This is the best discount currently available for customers paying by bank account/debit, so keep this active.[3][4][2]
- **Device Payments:** Multiple lines show ongoing monthly device payment charges (and corresponding device promo credits). If affordability is key, consider paying off completed devices outright (where the “Payment X of 36” agreement indicates you are near the end), then switching that line to a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) plan, which may qualify for additional savings in the future.
- **Plan Review:** Nearly all lines appear to be on Unlimited Welcome or Unlimited Plus plans. If any user on Unlimited Plus does not need the mobile hotspot or international benefits, consider moving them to Unlimited Welcome for the base savings per month.
- **Add-On Subscriptions:** No recurring entertainment add-ons are itemized, so no savings are available there.
- **International/Travel Charges:** You had single-use international/data add-ons (TravelPass/International Minutes). If you anticipate travel, consider prepaid international packages in advance to save versus pay-as-you-go rates.
- **Account-Wide Discounts:** You regularly benefit from “Loyal 10 for 12 MO” and “Valued Customer 30 Disc 4 PH” promotions. These are usually short-term and must be re-evaluated before they expire; call Verizon to ask for a new ongoing loyalty credit when one ends.
- **Plan Consolidation:** With lines for family/shared, Verizon “mix & match” means you can potentially adjust one or more lines to the lowest eligible plan tier without impacting the whole account. Make sure no one is on a higher tier than needed for their actual usage.
- **Review Surplus Lines/Lines with No Usage:** If there are lines with minimal or no activity (frequent in multi-line accounts), consider suspending or canceling these to cut costs. There are several “remaining lines” catch-all charges, so confirm that all active lines are used.
- **Activation Fees & New Lines:** Plan new activations together when Verizon is waiving fees with switch/promotions (often at the winter holidays, Black Friday, or student/switch specials).
