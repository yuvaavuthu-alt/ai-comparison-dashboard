### 36-Month Cost Breakdown for Family of Four

| Device | Monthly Payment | 2 Lines w/ Trade-In | 2 Lines w/o Trade-In | **Total (36 mo)** |
|:-------|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|
| **iPhone 16 Pro Max** | $30.55 | $0.00 | $2,199.60 | **$2,199.60** |
| Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | $36.11 | $299.92 | $2,599.92 | $2,899.84 |
| Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | $33.33 | $799.92 | $2,399.76 | $3,199.68 |

### Key Considerations

**Trade-In Requirements**[9][10]
Verizon accepts devices from any carrier in any condition for trade-in. The trade-in credit is applied as a monthly bill deduction over the 36-month device payment agreement. You must maintain eligibility requirements (staying on Unlimited Ultimate plan) for the full credit term. The phone must be active on your account for 60 days prior to trade-in (for upgrades), and you have 90 days to send in the device.[11]

**Unlimited Ultimate Plan**[10]
All three flagship options require Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan to qualify for maximum trade-in promotions. This plan typically starts at $90/month with AutoPay before taxes and fees. While this is the carrier's premium tier, the trade-in credits effectively offset the device cost for two lines, making the deal economically favorable.

**Recommended Configuration for Lowest Cost**
Upgrade two lines to the **iPhone 16 Pro Max with trade-in** (covering the full cost of those two devices) while the other two family members either maintain their current phones or upgrade without trade-in at the standard $30.55/month installment. This combination results in the lowest 36-month total of $2,199.60 for all four lines, saving approximately $700 compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra and $1,000 compared to the Pixele Pixel 9 Pro XL.
